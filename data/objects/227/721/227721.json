    "description": "This tapestry illustrates the second three ages of man, equated with the bridesman, in a tripartite composition. These eighteen years of life correspond to the months of April, May and June, and to the season of summer, presided over by Ceres, goddess of the harvest; she is identified in a Latin elegiac distich on a scroll in the border immediately below. Ceres is the usual deity of summer, but the pansies and daisies of her dress are not traditionally her flowers; they may refer here to Margaret of Austria, regent of the Netherlands form 1507\u20131530. Margaret of Austria also owned a green parrot, which may be commemorated in the bird shown here.Each of the three vertical sections includes a roundel at the top surrounded by twenty-four hourglasses on a ground that is light above and dark below, in varied proportions, according to the seasons. Each roundel contains a sign of the zodiac, here Taurus (erroneously: this should be Aries), Gemini and Cancer, and a figure symbolizing a month. The roundels are seen against the sky, which is dark blue at the top, and are flanked by winds, usually with their names inscribed on their bellows or elsewhere. Below the two outer roundels is a representation of the occupation of a month; here, gardening for April and sheep-shearing for June. Below the occupations and the center roundels are episodes from classical history, mythology, the Old Testament or the Apocryphal Gospels, each illustrating one of the twelve ages of man. Under April, is the Choice of Hercules, in which the sleeping youth Hercules proves his new-found maturity by choosing Minerva and Discipline over Venus and Vice. Under May, Venus and Adonis dally. Under June, the soldier being presented with arms is identified in his banderol as \"Curius\", therefore Marcus Curius Dentatus, who was prized for refusing brides from the Samnite ambassadors; however, since he seems to be accepting the arms, this is possibly an error and the triumphant young soldier is actually supposed to be Lucius Sicinius Dentatus whom, Pliny writes, was presented with arms in recognition of his bravery.The two outer episodes have framed Latin distichs, supported by pedestals, between them and the occupation of the month above; the center episode has a similar inscription between it and the deity below. The verses refer to the story illustrated. In the upper border, on scrolls held by winged boys, are three Latin distichs connecting each month with an age in the life of man. In the lower border, flanking the inscription below the deity, are two medallions containing an animal, bird or object. The foregrounds of all the scenes are filled with flowering and fruiting plants.",
