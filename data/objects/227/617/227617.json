    "description": "This pair of curtains, embroidered with chinoiserie designs, would have decorated the sides of a European state bed, usually reserved for important guests. Massive fantasy flora surrounds people dressed in vaguely Chinese garments and fantastic winged Asian dragons. Asymmetry, a feature of Chinese art that confounded and intrigued European observers, appears in these embroideries. Writers from the late seventeenth century and well into the eighteenth remarked on this characteristic that was prevalent in Chinese design and architecture and worlds apart from the balanced proportions championed in Europe. These early chinoiserie embroideries display the designer\u2019s attempt to capture this \"beautiful disorder\" that Europeans found so irresistible.",
