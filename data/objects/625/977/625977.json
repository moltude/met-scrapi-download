    "description": "This print is part of a series comprised of twenty-four Prophets and twelve Sibyls, modeled after the series of the same subject by Baccio Baldini (TIB 2403.052-.089).  Rosselli's engravings are executed in the Broad Manner and Italianate in style, whereas Baldini's are in the Fine Manner and mostly Germanic in style.  Rosselli's prints vary from faithful ciopies of Baldini's prints to loose adapations. This print is copied from Baccio Baldini's Prophet Jeremiah (TIB 2403.069).",
