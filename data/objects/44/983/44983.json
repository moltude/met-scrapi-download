    "description": "This resplendent vision of the Western Paradise, from Shin-Zenk\u014dji Temple, Moriya, \u014cmi Province, is one of the most compelling icons of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism. In Buddhist practice, the mandala maps the cosmos, revealing what we cannot see with our conventional wisdom. Often based on sutras, these paintings guide a visual exploration of doctrine and teachings (dharma) as an aid to enlightenment.Compositional symmetry and geometry\u2014even in more \"realistic\" mandalas like this one-suggest a timeless space where all things emanate from a sacred center. In the Taima mandala (named for a temple near Nara), Amit\u00e2bha Buddha (Amida, in Japanese) occupies the center, flanked by his attendants, the bodhisattvas Avalokiteshvara (Kannon) and Mahasthamaprapta (Seishi). In the pond before them believers are reborn in Paradise, unfolding from lotus blossoms. Everywhere heavenly musicians play; pavilions and trees are covered with jewels. It is an awe-inspiring display of unearthly beauty, but a closer look reveals that the practice necessary to enter this realm is actually represented in the tiny scenes that border the central court.",
