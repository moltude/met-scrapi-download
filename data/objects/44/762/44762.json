    "description": "The tiger, long venerated in Asia as a mythological guardian animal, occupied an important place not only in popular culture but also in the elite society of both Japan and Korea in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  A common symbol of auspicious powers in folk mythology, the tiger also proved a source of inspiration for monks and intellectuals.  The poem inscribed on this painting presents a Zen interpretation of the tiger as a symbol of one who ventures to embark on the true path to enlightenment:The recluse in a mountain cottage And the fabled puma in the Southern Mountain Indulge themselves in hiding from the world. The tiger does not lose his way here. Suddenly, at the painter's hands, He attains complete existence.This painting posed an intriguing question as to its origin.  It had initially been considered Korean despite its provenance in a Japanese collection.  The whimsical treatment of this dignified and terrifyingly powerful animal exhibits Korean sensibilities.  However, in the depiction of the fur and in the simple treatment of the paws, the painting displays the loose, freely executed brushwork characteristic of Japanese renditions of this subject since the early sixteenth century rather than the meticulous brushwork of Korean monochrome ink examples.  The posture of the animal is also more typical of Japanese tiger paintings.  The poem inscribed on the painting is traceable to an obscure monk named Shitaku Junka who lived at the famous Edo temple of Tokaiji in the early eighteenth century.  The artist, Meiso, whose name appears at the lower left corner, was almost certainly a Japanese monk-painter.",
