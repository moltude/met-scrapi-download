    "description": "This pivotal scene from a nine-handscroll set depicts the monk H\u014dnen (1133\u20131212), founder of the Pure Land School of Buddhism, inscribing a portrait of himself for one of his foremost disciples, Shinran (1173\u20131262). The young Shinran, easily recognizable by his bushy eyebrows, waits patiently as his master transcribes a passage from a sutra in which the Buddha Amida (Sanskrit: Amit\u0101bha) vows to save all those who call his name. The portrait H\u014dnen inscribes was made as a copy of the painting hanging in the center of the room. That painting depicts H\u014dnen with a lotus pedestal above his head, upon which the character for \u201cBuddha,\u201d from the phrase \u201cHail the name of Amida Buddha,\u201d is visible. The Sh\u016bikotokuden-e, one of several illustrated biographies of H\u014dnen, was compiled in 1301 by Shinran\u2019s relative Kakunyo (died 1351) in order to consolidate his position as Shinran\u2019s rightful successor. This painting comes from an early copy of the lost original. The text portion preceding the illustration here actually belongs to another section of the same scroll, and describes H\u014dnen\u2019s veneration of a portrait of Shandao. The painting associated with the text preserved here is lost.",
