    "description": "The writing box (suzuri-bako) contains an inkstone, a water dropper in the shape of cherry blossoms, and a brush. The design on the front of the lid is dominated by a rapid waterfall; the stream descends through a range of mountains and rocks surrounded by pine trees and bamboo grass. The river is depicted in gold and silver maki-e that has been burnished down until it is completely flat, a technique called togidashi. Fine lines express the fast-flowing water. At the bottom of the waterfall, bubbly waves are executed in silver and are further enhanced with silver-inlaid roundels to express water drops. There are seven gold-inlaid characters that might refer to a poem or express auspicious notions, such as \u201cturtle\u201d or \u201cthousand years.\u201d Inside the lid the waterfall design is repeated without the characters. The design might refer to the picturesque Miyano-taki falls near Yoshino (Nara Prefecture), a waterfall that has significance in Japanese literature.",
