    "description": "Artist, poet, novelist, and philosopher, Gibran Khalil Gibran emigrated from Lebanon to the United States in 1895. In 1904, he had his first exhibit in Boston and by 1908 he was attending the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris, where he exhibited his work in the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts. During that time, he also studied with the sculptor Auguste Rodin. In 1912, Gibran settled in New York, where he would remain until his death. His drawings and paintings are mystical, with lyrical movements of ethereal figures or portraits that enter a landscape like apparitions. His work often explores the symbols and elements of nature, time, and space while pushing the boundaries between physicality and spirituality. Gibran is best known for his writings, specifically The Prophet, which has been translated into more than twenty languages.",
