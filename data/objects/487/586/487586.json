    "description": "During the 1910s and 1920s a classical revival dominated Scandinavian design.  Danes and Swedes in particular made a push to develop their decorative arts industries, focusing their efforts on elegant and artistically conceived designs that would appeal to middle-class consumers.  Stylistic unity characterizes their work, and the movement has come to be known as New Classicism or Nordic (or sometimes more specifically Swedish) Grace.",
