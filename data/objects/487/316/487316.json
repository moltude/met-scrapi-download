    "description": "Puiforcat's name is synonymous with Art Deco glamour; even in his day, the important French silversmith was renowned for the elegant, often mathematical simplicity of his geometric forms and the unexpected combination of flawless metalwork with brilliantly polished hardstones, semiprecious stones, or glass. This coffee service shows one of Puiforcat's earliest attempts to break away from the preceding generation's taste for naturalism; the only vestiges are the lapis lazuli blossoms acting as knops on the lids. The introduction of lapis lazuli on this service is not only decorative but also practical; furthering the insulating effect of ivory spacers separating the handles from the heat of the coffeepot, the hardstone handles remain naturally cool to the touch.",
