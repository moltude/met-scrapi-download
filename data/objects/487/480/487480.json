    "description": "Part of a set consisting of a vitrine, table, armchair, and three side chairs, this table was designed by \u00c9douard Colonna for Siegfried Bing's display at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900. A German-born, Brussels-trained designer who moved to America in 1882, Colonna first worked for Associated Artists, the design firm of Louis Comfort Tiffany, and then as a stove designer for Barney & Smith Manufacturing Company in Dayton, Ohio. In 1887, he produced a collection of decorative engravings, Essay on Broomcorn, based upon the intertwining strands of a type of sorghum with long flower stalks used in making brooms. Colonna's elegant interpretations of these plants were a testament to his own virtuosity and the arrival of the continental Art Nouveau style in America. Lost by a New York distributor at Colonna's expense, the design book never reached its intended audience of artists. He later returned to Europe and was employed by Siegfried Bing between 1898 and 1903.",
