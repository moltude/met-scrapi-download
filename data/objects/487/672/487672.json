    "description": "A one-time assistant to Rodin, Pompon first showed this sculpture in plasterat the Salon d\u2019Automne in 1922, when he was sixty-seven. Its popularity led toits production in a variety of sizes, from tabletop to full scale, and a range ofmediums, including plaster, porcelain, and marble. It was a favorite model of hisfriend Ruhlmann, who used it in two of his interiors at the 1925 Paris exposition:a small version in the salon of his own pavilion and life-size version shown at thepavilion of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes D\u00e9corateurs. The Metropolitan purchased thissculpture from the Galerie Edgar Brandt in 1930.",
