    "description": "In 1869 de Morgan, a painter and stained-glass artist who designed tiles and glass for the William Morris firm, began decorating pottery; by 1873 he was running a highly successful pottery manufacture. He revived the medieval luster technique to decorate ceramics with an iridescent metallic surface, and from about 1875 favored \"Persian\" colors-pigments made from such metallic oxides as silver, which produces a brassy yellow, and copper, for a rich ruby red. These lusterwares were shown at the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris.",
