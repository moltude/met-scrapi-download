The left forearm has been lost from this otherwise extremely faithful reproduction.  In 1920 the Gillierons also offered for sale a reconstituted version of this statuette in painted plaster with long black hair and a belted cod piece at the waist.  The original is in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum.",
