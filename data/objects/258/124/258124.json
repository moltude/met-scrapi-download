Gillieron's reproduction made soon after the initial discovery is much more readable than the original is today. Flowering crocuses fill the foreground.  Above are light blue flowers with broad leaves that have been identified as violets.  Crete has over 500 endemic species of wild flowers.  The original is in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum, Crete.",
