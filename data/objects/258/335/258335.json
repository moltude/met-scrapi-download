    "description": "Excavated 1876, Shaft Grave V, Grave Circle A,  Mycenae.Heinrich Schliemann believed that he had discovered in Shaft Grave V the remains of Agamemnon, the fabled ruler of Mycenae, who led the Greeks to Troy, and was immortalized in Homer's epic, The Iliad.  This gold mask, the finest of six unearthed in Schliemann's excavations, came to be known as the \"Mask of Agamemnon\" although the body Schliemann originally identified as Agamemnon had a different round-faced gold death mask. Its fame was bolstered by the fact that it was the only gold mask reproduced by the Gillierons, whose reproductions circulated widely.  It  is one of two versions made by E. Gillieron, pere and represents the mask restored to its original appearance. The original is in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens.",
