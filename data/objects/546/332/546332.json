    "description": "The five miniature ointment jars 33.1.16-.20 were excavated in the subsiduary shaft tomb 29 in the area of the mastaba of Senwosretankh at Lisht South.  The shaft led to two chambers.  In the debris filling the shaft and both chambers were found remains of a funerary mask (33.1.64) covered with gold foil and inscribed with so-called mutilated hieroglyphs (hieroglyphic signs of birds and other animals without feet), a style of writing that is found on objects from the late 12th Dynasty through the beginning of the 18th.  Pottery vessels also found in this tomb 29 debris date to the late Hyksos time (ca. 1580-1540 B. C.).  Some of the pots formerly MMA 33.1.149-.157, are now in the Oriental Institute Chicago ).",
