    "description": "This distinctive tall, cylindrical shape is characteristic of a group of Safavid lamp stands which share a similar silhouette and ornamentation. Many are covered with lyrical and mystical verses by celebrated poets of the period, reflecting the important relationship between Persian poetry and the visual arts. Linked cartouches contain arabesques, animal motifs and calligraphic blessings, as well as lines in nasta\u2019liq which read:\"To holy men thy face is light and seeing thy face is my light. Like men of heart I see my light only when near thee. Thou art the aim of the world; without thee it is nothing. I see all the world as a small thing of thee. ...candle; if you don't burn. I am a beggar; one day near thee...\"",
