    "description": "These types of wares\u2013with a flared mouth and bulbous body\u2013 were produced in vivid blues and greens, illustrating the range of colors employed by glassmakers in the 18th and 19th centuries. These vessels were admired for their graceful shapes and often decoratively displayed within niches of private and public buildings in Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. The end of the spout is decorated with an applied 'butterfly' in the same color of deep blue, and the dainty handle suggests the object may have been more decorative than functional.",
