    "description": "Similar stands were widely employed in the Mamluk period to host large rounded metal trays (such as 91.1.604), on which fruits and other food were displayed.The cup motif inlaid with copper stands out among the richly decoration of this tray. It was a blazon of the cupbearer, one of the differentiated offices of the court of the Mamluk sultans. The inscription reads Husain, son of Qawsun, who was cupbearer to Muhammad b. Qalawun (al-Malik al-Nasir) (1294\u20131340/41). Despite having been ousted after the sultan\u2019s death, Qawsun\u2019s prestige must have endured, as his sons continued to use his emblem of the ringed cup set within a divided shield.The glass mosque lamp 17.190.991 was also made for him, as indicated by its inscription.",
