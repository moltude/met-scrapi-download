    "description": "These two vases were made at the time of the French Revolution, at a factory that was located in the heart of Revolutionary Paris. Decorated with landscapes depicting severe storms, the people in both landscapes are at the mercy of the wild forces of nature. These scenes, highly unusual for French porcelain, can be plausibly seen as reflections of the tumultuous period during which the vases were produced.",
