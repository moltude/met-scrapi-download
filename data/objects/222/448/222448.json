    "description": "This cap crown is unusual for its depiction of a character from classical mythology\u2014Orpheus, playing his lyre to charm the birds and animals around him. This type of bobbin lace is called Mechlin, so named for the town where it was made. It is a straight lace, meaning the motifs are made at the same time as the background mesh (in this case, hexagonal), with a thicker thread of shiny linen defining the motifs. This piece was made in three lengths, each using more than five hundred thread-wound bobbins. The strips are cleverly joined in an irregular path around motifs, avoiding joins in the mesh, which are hard to conceal. Strips of straight lace are only limited in width by the number of bobbins that can fit on a lace pillow.",
