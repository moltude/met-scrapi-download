    "description": "Hokusai searched the environment for subjects that would produce an unusual effect when combined with the image of Mount Fuji. In this print, he takes us to Owari (present-day Aichi Prefecture), which is one of the western most locations from which Mount Fuji is visible. Having come all this way, Hokusai puts the mountain, now greatly diminished in size by distance, in the center of a great circular frame formed by the walls of a huge barrel being constructed by a cooper. Thus, the great symbol of eternity is amusingly reduced to a tiny triangle set within a large bottomless barrel.",
