One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets is a famous anthology of classical waka poems.On a label at the upper right corner,  a poem by Minamoto Muneyuki (d. 939) is inscribed:  In a mountain hamlet winter's loneliness grows deeper.Both people and grasses are withered\u2014so runs my thoughts.In contrast to the waka poem, which concentrates on the loneliness of winter in the mountains, Hokusai's hunters, clustered around a big fire in the snow, have a mad animation characteristic of ky\u014dka, the playful verse more popular in the late Edo period than waka.",
