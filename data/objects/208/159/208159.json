    "description": "The ath\u00e9nienne was a completely new, multifunctional type of French Neoclassical furniture derived from the tripod-shaped perfume burner of classical antiquity. It could be used as a washstand, perfume burner, food warmer, and jardini\u00e8re. It was invented, probably in 1773, by Jean-Henri Eberts, editor of Le Monument du Costume (a series of etchings on the history of French costume in the eighteenth century), and was first advertised in L'avantcoureur in September 1773. Only a single engraving of the advertisement, now in the Library of the University of Warsaw, appears to have survived. Eberts stated in his advertisement that the ath\u00e9nienne could be examined and acquired at the shop of the gilder and color-merchant Jean-F\u00e9lix Watin, the author of a popular handbook on gilding, L'art du peintre, doreur, vernisseur. In Eberts's engraving the ath\u00e9nienne is shown as a perfume burner, whereas the present example, which is one of a pair in the Museum's collection, is designed for use as a jardini\u00e8re.Several examples of the ath\u00e9nienne have survived. One of the earliest may have been supplied to Madame Du Barry (1743\u20131793) at Louveciennes in 1774. But the present pair is closest in design to Eberts's engraving. Eberts owned a painting by Joseph-Marie Vien (1716\u20131809), La Vertueuse Ath\u00e9nienne, which includes a tripod that was once thought to be the source of Eberts's design, but because the correspondence is not close, that idea was subsequently played down by French furniture expert Sir Francis Watson: \"Nevertheless, since Eberts owned the painting there may well have been some link between the two in his mind.\"Watson suggests that all of the surviving ath\u00e9niennes may have been made by the same unidentified cabinetmaker. Whether this is the obscure A. P. Dupain who stamped one of the surviving pairs is not known. He may just have specialized in their production.",
