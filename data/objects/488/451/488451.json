    "description": "Among de Zayas's favorite subjects at\"291\" were the photographers of the Photo-Secession, including Gertrude K\u00e4sebier, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Clarence White, and Edward Steichen. Usually showing them with their cameras, de Zayas was able to capture their individual facial features and personalities, even as he stylized their figures and poses. Here, K\u00e4sebier (1852-1934), one of the grande dames of the group, stares menacingly from behind her large camera, her rotund body echoing the shape of her photographic equipment.",
