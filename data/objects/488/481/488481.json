    "description": "Reaching Waves was painted while Dove and the artist Helen Torr (1886\u20131967) were living as winter caretakers in a waterside cottage near Noroton, Connecticut.  Dove, a seasoned boatman, would have been conscious of the tides on Long Island Sound and of the water's changed appearance in chilly weather.  Such observations are distilled in this monochromatic abstraction filled with movement.  The irregular forms of the waves, some tipped with flecks of white paint to simulate foam, rush across an implied shoreline.",
