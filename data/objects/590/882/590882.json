    "description": "Khety was the first recorded royal treasurer (\u201coverseer of what is sealed\u201d) of Mentuhotep II (ca. 2051\u20132000 B.C.). Royal treasurers ranked directly under the pharaoh, on the same level with the vizier and the chief royal steward.The tomb of Khety was situated high up in the cliffs at Deir el-Bahri, near the mortuary complex of the king. These relief fragments once lined the tomb\u2019s entrance passage.The ancient Egyptians kept pet monkeys (baboons as well as the more slender guenons) for amusement and as status symbols. These  animals played around the house and accompanied the master on outings. During trips abroad they amused the sailors with their pranks. Fragments from the tomb of Khety may belong to the representation of such a sea voyage with the monkeys playing around the ship.On the very right, a baboon walks beside an archer; in the center, near a large container, two other monkeys seem to be climbing on top of each other. The scars that appear on the arm of one of the men are a mystery. Was the man bitten repeatedly by a monkey? Part of what might be the figure of an animal is preserved below the arm.Part of this scene is on a corner block; the remains of an inscription can be seen on the perpendicular face.",
