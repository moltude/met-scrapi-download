    "description": "Beads carved in the form of a Coleoptera or click beetle (Agrypnus notodonta) are highly unusual and their subject and large size suggests they were not meant to be wearable jewelry. Faience beads of comparable size recovered from early temple deposits support the idea that these beads may have been offerings or ritual equipment from an early  shrine.  Such donations were well known from Pharonic times. The click beetle was an insect sacred to Neit, an early and powerful goddess, whose realm was hunting and war.",
