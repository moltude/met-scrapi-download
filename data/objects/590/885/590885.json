    "description": "The tomb of Khety, the first recorded royal treasurer of Mentuhotp III, was situated high up in the cliffs at Deir el-Bahri. The relief fragments displayed here derive from the tomb\u2019s entrance passage, which was lined with decorated limestone blocks.The fragments in this group show two standards (carrying poles). They were each decorated with a feather at the end of the horizontal section, but only the stem of one of these feathers is preserved. An ointment vase stood below each carrying pole; and again only one is preserved.On top of the standards are bows that the artists have rendered as if they were standing upright. This isprobably only to show the objects in full view; in reality they would have been laid flat on top of the standards. On the top right is the fragmentary depiction of a box on which a beaded collar is displayed. Again, this collar was in reality most probably inside the box. On the fragments at the bottom (26.3.354g1), the foot of a piece of furniture and some pendants at the end of a necklace are preserved. The word menkhet (clothing) appears twice, indicating what was represented in the register below.",
