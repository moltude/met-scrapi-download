    "description": "Bronze, marble, frit, quartz, and obsidianGreek and Roman statues were designed to give a colorful lifelike impression.  Marble and wood sculptures were brightly painted, and bronze statues were originally a pale fleshlike brown.  Lips and nipples were often inlaid with copper, and teeth with silver.  Eyes were usually made separately and set into prepared sockets.  This pair, designed for an over-lifesize statue, gives a sense of the potent immediacy that ancient sculpture could convey.",
