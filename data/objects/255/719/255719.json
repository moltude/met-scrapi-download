    "description": "The Judgement of ParisBy the last decade of the sixth century B.C., there were artists who had achieved a virtuosic mastery of the red-figure technique and were responsible for the predominance that it gained over black-figure. Euthymides, a potter and painter,was one of these innovators belonging to what has been called the Pioneer Group. While Euthymides' signature as potter appears on the foot here, the painter remains unidentified. The goddesses following Hermes are Aphrodite, Athena, and Hera.",
