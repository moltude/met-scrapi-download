    "description": "The daguerreotype, the first photographic process, spread rapidly around the world after its inventor Louis Daguerre (1787-1851) made a public presentation in Paris in 1839.  Exposed in a camera obscura and developed in mercury vapors, each highly polished silvered copper plate is a unique photograph that, viewed in proper light, exhibits extraordinary detail and three-dimensionality.  Like a mirror, the daguerreotype presents its image reversed laterally.While the Boston partnership of Southworth & Hawes produced the finest portrait daguerreotypes in America for a clientele that included leading political, intellectual, and artistic figures, the firm also attempted a small number of views.  This scene from their studio window on Tremont Row shows a slow-moving funeral procession leaving the Brattle Street church, beyond which can be seen the masts of ships moored in the Boston harbor.",
