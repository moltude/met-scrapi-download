    "description": "This facsimile painting copies an entire wall in the tomb of Nakht (TT 52) at Thebes. The wall has been split into two registers with Nakht and his wife, Tawy, seated at the left in both.  At the right side of the upper register, Nakht and his family are shown twice: hunting birds (at the left) and fishing (at the right). The upper half of the bottom register shows the process of making wine and the lower half shows birds being caught in a clap-net and then prepared for storage in jars.The facsimile was painted at the tomb, probably around 1909-1910, by Norman deGaris Davies, director of the Graphic Section of the Museum's Egyptian Expedition.",
