    "description": "Ptolemy VI Philometor ascended the throne as a child and his mother, Cleopatra I, acted as regent. He married his sister, Cleopatra II, and ruled jointly with her. A period of constant dynastic and political intrigue, continuing conflict with the Seleucids of Syria, and uprisings in Egypt led to Roman intervention in Egyptian affairs which would culminate in the invasion by Julius Caesar.This small limestone head depicts the Hellenistic king wearing a traditional nemes headcloth with a uraeus on his brow. There is a scarab beetle on top of his head.",
