    "description": "Four jars with animal heads (25.3.205a-d) were found in the tomb of a woman named Ankhshepenwepet who lived during Dynasty 25. These are \"dummy\" canopic jars made of solid stone and can't be opened. In earlier periods, canopic jars were made to store the four internal organs that were removed during mummification. By Ankhshepenwepet's time, these organs were preserved, wrapped, and returned to the body instead of being placed in jars. However, canopic jars had been part of funerary equipment since the Pyramid Age, more than 1500 years earlier, and dummy jars were often provided instead of functional jars.",
