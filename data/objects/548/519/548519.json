    "description": "In this statue, Hatshepsut is portrayed as a male pharaoh dressed in the costume of an Egyptian king, althought she does not wear the usual false beard.  Like all the statues from Hatshepsut's temple, this one was broken into many pieces after her death by her nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III.  Unlike most of the others, the features of her face have also been systematically destroyed.  Certain details of the statue were originally painted, and traces of pigment are still visible on the headdress and broad collar.",
