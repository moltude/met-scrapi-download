    "description": "Such mirror cases were made by ivory carvers called pigniers, who specialized in them as well as combs.  Among the most popular products of Gothic ivory carvers, mirrors were made in pairs so that they could be stored facing each other, to protect the polished metal surfaces, and they were often sold in leather cases.  The courtly subject matter, elegant carving, and use of a luxury material such as ivory indicate that they were intended for aristocratic clients; medieval inventories confirm that these objects frequently belonged to such households.",
