    "description": "These panels are from a casket that illustrated Joshua\u2019s conquest of the Promised Land and carry paraphrasings of texts from the Book of Joshua. The first narrative panel, designed to fit a lock plate, shows the capture of the city of Ai and is inscribed, \u201cAnd Joshua stretched out his hand toward the city and they rose up quickly and they slew all\u201d (Joshua 8:18\u201319). The second panel shows the captive king of Ai, first bent in submission before Joshua and then, at the far right, hanged on a forked stake. The inscription reads, \u201cAnd they brought the King of Ai to Joshua and they hanged him\u201d (8:23, 29). The third panel, showing emissaries from the Gibeonites approaching Joshua, has the inscription, \u201cThe Gibeonites displaying their torn clothes\u201d (9:13). Joshua\u2019s story was often invoked in the middle Byzantine period, when Byzantines identified themselves with God\u2019s chosen people, likening their own military victories and defeats to those of the ancient Hebrews.",
