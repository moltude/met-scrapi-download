    "description": "In 628\u201329 the Byzantine emperor Herakleios (r. 610\u201341) successfully ended a long, costly war with Persia and regained Jerusalem, Egypt, and other Byzantine territory. Silver stamps dating to 613\u201329/30 on the reverse of these masterpieces place their manufacture in Herakleios\u2019s reign. The biblical figures on the plates wear the costume of the early Byzantine court, suggesting to the viewer that, like Saul and David, the Byzantine emperor was a ruler chosen by God. Elaborate dishes used for display at banquets were common in the late Roman and early Byzantine world; generally decorated with classical themes, these objects conveyed wealth, social status, and learning. This set of silver plates may be the earliest surviving example of the use of biblical scenes for such displays. Their intended arrangement may have closely followed the biblical order of the events, and their display may have conformed to the shape of a Christogram, or monogram for the name of Christ.In order to prove that he can kill Goliath, David describes to Saul how he killed a lion (1 Samuel 17:34\u201337). The accomplished naturalism of David\u2019s flowing cape and the lion\u2019s fur and mane demonstrates a conscious reference to and continuity of the traditions of Greco-Roman art.",
