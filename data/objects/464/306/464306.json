    "description": "Byzantine ivories were highly prized in western Europe, where they survived in church treasuries or were incorporated into deluxe book bindings. The ivory from the panel on the left originally formed the center of a Byzantine three-paneled icon. It may have been one of the many gifts to the Monastery of Santa Cruz de la Ser\u00f3s, which was founded by Queen Felicia (d. 1085), wife of Sancho V Ram\u00edrez (r. 1076\u201394), king of Aragon and Navarre. The sumptuous cover also contains a sapphire seal, located to the right of Saint John.  The other cover is inscribed with Felicia's name, below the ivory crucifix, inscribed in Arabic with four of the ninety-nine \"Beautiful Names\" of God.",
