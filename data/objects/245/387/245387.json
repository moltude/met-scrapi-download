    "description": "Translucent patchy purple.Uneven rim folded out, round, and in; flaring mouth; cylindrical neck, slanting to one side and with deep tooling indent at base; plastic body; oval base with rounded edges and slightly concave bottom; small round pontil mark on bottom. Mold seams visible on sides of head, extending to base of neck.Body in the shape of two heads, back to back, one with a smiling face, the other with a serious face; smiling face with fillet across forehead and hair parted down middle and arranged in regular horizontal rows to sides of face; the serious face with wavy hair to sides and prominent topknot; smiling face has arched eyebrows extending to bridge of nose, eyes with indents for pupils, open mouth, thick lips, and rounded chin; serious face is less well defined with raised eyebrows, a broad flat nose, pursed lips, and a receding chin.Intact; limy encrustation, thick creamy weathering, and brilliant iridescence.Although the details on two heads are indistinct, the fact that the smiling face wears a fillet or headband and the serious face may have small curved horns on his temples suggests that they may be identified as the wine god Dionysos and a satyr respectively.",
