    "description": "Translucent pale green.Outsplayed unworked rim; cylindrical body with vertical sides; uneven, flat bottom. Two vertical mold seams run down sides from rim to edge of bottom, with a separate disk-shaped base section.On body, large central frieze bordered above and below by a horizontal wreath with chevrons, facing in opposite directions: the frieze contains six large loops of vine tendrils, three on each side, each loop enclosing a vine leaf in outline or a stylized grape cluster comprising a series of dots; on one side, two leaves flank a cluster; on the other, two clusters flank a leaf. On bottom, projecting rounded ring and central dot.Chips missing in rim and larger holes in lower body and around edge of bottom; few bubbles; some dulling and reddish brown encrustation, with faint weathering and iridescence.Although closely related to Victory beakers, such as 81.10.210 and 81.10.214 also displayed here, this drinking cup has a more general appeal with its decoration of stylized vine leaves and grape clusters.",
