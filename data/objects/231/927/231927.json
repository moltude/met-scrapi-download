    "description": "Louis XVI commissioned the tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs from Beauvais with four related tapestries. The personifications of the continents are set in landscapes on the seat backs, and animals native to each populate the seat covers. This set vividly reflects the late eighteenth-century Gallic worldview. One settee shows America (left) being introduced to Europe (center right) by France (center left), who is receiving a crown from Victory. This scene is contrasted with those on the other settee, where Asia (left) and Africa (right) are shown surrounded by the material wealth their lands can offer Europe, including luxurious jewels and textiles from Asia and ivory and Africans (shown in chains) from Africa.",
