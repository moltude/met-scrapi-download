    "description": "The small state of Sawar was founded in 1627, and its rajas are related to those of Mewar. In the early eighteenth century, an artist working for Maharaja Raj Singh (1646\u20131730) produced an exceptional, stylistically distinct group of colored drawings that were probably inspired by like works, in turn based on Mughal prototypes, being made at the Mewari court of Amar Singh II. Here, Maharaja Raj Singh, enormous in scale, is adored by the comparatively diminutive ladies from his harem, who touch and tie ribbons to his clothing and hold gifts for him. Paintings of similar scenes from Kishangarh portray the raja's birthday celebration, at which the prince reciprocates his wives' tokens with gifts for them.",
