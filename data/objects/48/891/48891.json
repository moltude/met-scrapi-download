    "description": "An elegant beauty dressed in black has rushed to the snow-covered quay, where a boat is waiting, perhaps with her lover under its roof. Snow is everywhere\u2014on the opposite side of the river, where a torii (gate to a Shinto shrine) is dimly visible; on houses; on the boat; and on the bank where she stands. Breaking the harsh contrast of black against white are the brilliant reds of her undersash, her undergarment, and a clog, which are all delicately outlined in gold ink. Hokuba, who often signed his name Teisei Hokuba, was one of the most successful pupils of the great master Hokusai. A prolific artist, almost up to his teacher's caliber, Hokuba produced many paintings and prints.",
