    "description": "Taiga was one of the most prolific artists of the Nanga school, which was inspired by Chinese literati painting. This intimate landscape was painted with the artist's fingers rather than with a brush. Manipulating the effects of ink to create an almost abstract presentation, Taiga employed a technique known as tarashikomi, in which ink is applied over a still-wet surface.",
