The tilted heads draw attention to a wreath enclosing a shield that may have once contained a coat of arms. From the figures\u2019 windswept curls to the ribbons on the wreath, swirling forms heighten the composition\u2019s liveliness. Corresponding to a Renaissance reinterpretation of ancient imagery, the decoration may have been inspired by northern or Italian prints, which frequently served as models for the carvings adorning French chests.",
