    "description": "The statuette is a rare and unusual sculpture best described as a Campanian (west central Italian) bronze of the fifth century B.C. It most likely served as a votive offering to the gods, presented at a sanctuary either in anticipation of divine favor or in fulfillment of a previous promise or vow. The precise identity of the figure is uncertain; both his close-fitting garment and tight-fitting cap adorned with rosettes are uncommon details. The bronze is especially interesting for its remarkable stylistic affinities with both Greek and Etruscan art, characteristic of Campanian works made in a region where Greek, Italic, and Etruscan peoples were living in close proximity.",
