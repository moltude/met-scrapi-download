    "description": "The famous scientist al-Biruni, writing in the early 11th century, reports that Basra (Bassora) in Iraq was a center of rock crystal manufacture. Also, no other centers of rock carving production have been identified for the early and the middle Islamic periods. The lobed shape of this stunning small bowl, a rare example of Central Asian rock crystal vessel, follows a long established tradition in that region and is found in a whole range of materials, such as metals, stone and ceramics. Despite the fact that we have no information on places of production eastwards of Iraq, there is no reason to believe that in the Iranian and Central Asian territories the legacy of Sasanian rock crystal manufacture was left entirely inactive.",
