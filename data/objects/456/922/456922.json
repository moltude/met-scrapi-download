    "description": "This painting of a procession is attributed to Venkatchellam, court painter to Mir Nizam 'Ali Khan, Asaf Jah II (r. 1762\u20131803), the nizam of Hyderabad. While the landscape and background are only sketchily indicated, the men seated in the palanquin are depicted in great detail, down to their necklaces, of which every pearl is raised from the surface of the page. Leading the procession are rows of soldiers in Indian garb, while bringing up the rear are soldiers in European-style uniforms who carry muskets with bayonets.",
