    "description": "The metal body of this graceful chandelier is composed of a vase fitted with a slender, spiral-fluted neck of gilt bronze, topped by an arrangement of various fruits. Two pairs of S-shaped candle branches emerge from the folded arms of two beautifully modeled female half-figures evolving from acanthus leaves, while additional branches spring from between the horns of two satyr masks. The combination of varnished metal and gilt bronze offers the kind of rich and sophisticated contrast favored during the late eighteenth century. This chandelier has been attributed to the bronze worker Fran\u00e7ois R\u00e9mond, based on similarities with some of his documented work. A highly successful artist, R\u00e9mond worked for the marchand-mercier Dominique Daguerre and was patronized by the comte d\u2019Artois and Marie-Antoinette. Several variants of this model are known; a closely related chandelier is in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e Nissim de Camondo, Paris.",
