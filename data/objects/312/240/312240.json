    "description": "Ancient gold work from Colombia varied in style, technology, and imagery. Nose ornaments especially were made in many shapes and styles over millennia. Forms and sizes are sometimes so extraordinary that they seem unwearable to the modern viewer. Depictions of human figures in ceramic and metal, however, show such nose ornaments being worn. Long, heavy ornaments with wide ends, such as these examples, are seen placed in the septum of the nose. The ornaments from the Sin\u00fa region in northwestern Colombia are often cast with delicate false filigree of braided and spiral elements, as here.According to postconquest, sixteenth-century records, Sin\u00fa gold objects came from a region called Gran Zen\u00fa. Located on the tropical lowlands of the Caribbean coast, Gran Zen\u00fa was composed of three provinces\u2014Zenufana, Finzen\u00fa, and Panzen\u00fa\u2014and stretched east from the Sin\u00fa River to the Nech\u00ed and Magdalena river areas. Recent archival research relates the gold works from this region to the Zen\u00fa, a people present at the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century. The descendants of the Zen\u00fa still live east of the lower Sin\u00fa River.",
