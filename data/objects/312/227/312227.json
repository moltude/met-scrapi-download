    "description": "Gold has played an important role in the art and history of Ghana since the fourteenth century. At that time, Mande merchants extended their Saharan trade routes southward to gain access to gold deposits. In the late fifteenth century, European navigators found this area so rich in gold that they named it the Gold Coast, a term used to describe the region until Ghanaian independence in 1957. As a result of the lucrative gold trade, the Akan peoples of Ghana established small states that grew in size, complexity, and splendor over the centuries. In 1701 a confederation of central forest states emerged as a united power under a single paramount leader, becoming the Asante kingdom.            The Akan developed a system for weighing gold dust based on North African, Dutch, and Portuguese measures. Gold dust was placed on a scale using brass spoons and weighed with cast-brass weights of varying sizes. Chiefs and notables stored gold dust in delicate cast-brass containers modeled after prototypes from north Africa that were brought to Ghana during its early involvement with the trans-Saharan gold trade.This gold dust box is a pair with 1978.412.388a, b.",
