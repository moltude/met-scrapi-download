    "description": "Sheng Maoye, a professional painter active in his native Suzhou, shows in his work a lively interest in the shifting atmospheric effects of landscapes in mist and rain or of clouds at twilight or dawn. In these album leaves, images suggested by couplets excerpted from Tang-dynasty (618\u2013907) poems provided the springboard for the artist's imagination. Sheng's interest in exploring the descriptive potentialsof monochrome ink\u2014sometimes with the addition of pale colors\u2014to suggest different states of atmospheric realism was shared by his contemporaries in the Nanjing area, including Fan Qi (1616\u2013after 1694) and Gong Xian (1619\u20131689).",
