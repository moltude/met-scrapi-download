    "description": "The motif of chrysanthemums on a stream recalls the auspicious story of a mythical Chinese river whose water, sweetened by dewdrops from the chrysanthemums growing alongside it, imparts eternal life to anyone who drinks it. The lacquered surface of this small rack is decorated in the \u201cpear skin\u201d (nashiji) technique, in which small flecks of sprinkled gold densely cover the ground area. The rack must have been made as part of a wedding trousseau, as it features two superimposed family crests, one of plum blossoms and the other of nine stars.",
