The kanoko spots of both the camellias and fence appear to have been produced with a stencil, not by tying in the shibori technique. Although stencil-dyed kanoko has sometimes been thought to be related to sumptuary laws of the early 1680s, an earlier securely dated kanoko robe of the mid-seventeenth century shows clear evidence of having been patterned by stencil.",
