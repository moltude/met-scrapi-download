Parker and Wakelin\u2019s accounts for the sale show that the service included eight such boxes, a pair of candlesticks, two \"essence pots,\" a looking glass, a \"jewells trunk,\" and a pair of octagonal pierced trays. The cost for gilding the service was more than \u00a356\u2014roughly equal to the annual wage of a successful artisan\u2014and the entire bill came to more than \u00a3300. There was a further charge of \u00a36 6s for a \"red morocco leather case with a drawer & 2 cushions.\"",
