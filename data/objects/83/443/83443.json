    "description": "As fashion's last absolute decree entered its concluding phase, skirts became shorter and shorter until they atrophied into short shorts, or, in the phrase of the day, hot pants.

As self-consciously insurrectionist as the political gesture is, the craft of the garment is, like Chanel's \"little black dress,\" traditional.",
