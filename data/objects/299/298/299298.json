    "description": "Around the turn of the twentieth century, printers developed sophisticated color processes that could transform black-and-white photographs into deeply saturated chromolithographs produced in various formats, from postcards to large panoramas. The photographs used as the basis for these commercial prints were not merely colorized\u2014they were also cropped, retouched, and extensively reconfigured to serve the demands of the market. Technicians began by creating large collages of photographic and painted elements. These were then re-photographed and transferred to printing stones, where the color was added. In this maquette, William Henry Jackson\u2019s austere photograph of the Animas River canyon in Colorado was significantly altered\u2014trees were removed, mountains were added to the background\u2014eventually resulting in a picture perfect postcard.",
