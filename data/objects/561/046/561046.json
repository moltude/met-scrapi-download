    "description": "Faience cups of this type are frequent in the Late Period. A recent study of faience vessels notes that examples were found in the western dump at the Sacred Animal Necropolis at Saqqara, where datable documents belong to the 5th-4th centuries B.C. The cups vary in size; examples are known that were inscribed and found in sets of 7 for the 7 sacred oils. The type may have continued to be produced during the Graeco-Roman period, but the quality of the glaze here - very thick and most often with regular craquelure in a regular manner - seems characteristic of the Late Period.",
