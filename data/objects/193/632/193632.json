    "description": "Matthias Walbaum was one of the best goldsmiths in sixteenth-century Augsburg, and elaborate shrines of an almost neo-Gothic character were the specialty of his workshop.  This jewel-like example, in the form of a triptych, documents episodes from the New Testament in hierarchical order.  Atop the shrine is a Visitation scene with figures of Saints Anne and Elizabeth and an announcing angel.  On the front of the doors are silver figures enacting the Annunciation.  The doors open into a miniature triptych painted in gouache by Anton Mozart, with the Nativity at the center, the Presentation on the right wing, and the Circumcision on the left.  A tiny panel illustrating the Flight into Egypt forms the predella.  On the stem of the shrine a Christ in silver bears his cross to Calvary; beneath, his collapsed figure hangs from his mother's arms in a Piet\u00e0.  On the four sides of the base, the Evangelists, identified by their attributes, record the events pictured above.",
