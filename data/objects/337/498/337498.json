    "description": "This watercolor seems to have been intended as an artistic end in itself, since it is not a study for a known painting.  Panini did use the composition, however, in a series of pairs of paintings executed between 1756 and 1758, representing picture galleries crowded with many views of either ancient or modern Rome.  In the \"Roma Moderna\" of the first pair, which was commissioned by the Duke of Choiseul and is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Scalinata is seen from the same perspective as in this drawing.  The \"Roma Moderna\" of the second pair, which is also in the Metropolitan Museum (52.63.2), includes the Scalinata as well, on the floor to the left of the Duke, just as it is in the Boston painting.  In the third set, now in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, the Scalinata is high on the wall to the right.",
