    "description": "This punchbowl, which was produced for export to England, is decorated with four scenes of musicians playing their instruments. The larger scenes depict European musicians while the smaller ones on the sides show Chinese musicians in concert.  A print by an anonymous British artist served as the source for the painted scene on the bowl's front. Elaborate gilding and small vignettes of Chinese landscapes enhance the punchbowl's ambitious decorative scheme.",
