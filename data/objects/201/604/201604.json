    "description": "This tapestry is from a set of eight, traditionally called Les Sujets de la Fable d'apr\u00e8s Jules Romain [Mythological subjects after Giulio Romano]. The designs for all eight tapestries were based upon drawings in Louis XIV's collection which were all, at that time, attributed to Giulio Romano.In a woodland setting, three men and three women dance in a ring. A pile of musical instruments lies in front of them on the bank of a stream. Despite the traditional nomenclature of this piece, there are no attributes identifying these bucolic figures as shepherds. The ultimate source of the design, a fresco by Giulio Romano and assistants in the sala dei venti in the Palazzo del Te, Mantua, shows the effects on those born under the constellation of the Goat during its ascendency.",
