    "description": "Architecturally-shaped tabernacle with a protruding ressault in the shape of a portico crowned by a slender tower in the middle. The tabernacle is characterized by five niches, seperated by pillars. The central niche is higher than the other four and contains the statue of a male saint, dressed as a soldier and holding a banner (possibly Longinus). Putti have been placed in the other four niches, they are depicted in different poses and are holding various attributes. Shades have been added to the design by the use of grey wash.",
