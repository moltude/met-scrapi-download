    "description": "The ankle boot was briefly revived in the years around 1939 as a compliment to the Romantic era inspired fashions then in vogue.  Although not a widely worn style, numerous designers included them in their lines, no other perhaps to the extent of Andr\u00e9 Perugia.  As one would expect from its premier French maker, the design of this pair of boots from the Brooklyn Museum is embued with a general elegance, while following the current last shape and introducing an interesting tabbed treatment along the top.  Perugia collaborated with many of the top couturiers for over sixty years, most notably with Paul Poiret in the 1910s and 1920s, and Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1930s.  He was an innovator on all fronts; style, construction technology, and utilization of materials.",
