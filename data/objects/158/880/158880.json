    "description": "Caroline Reboux was one of the most renowned high-fashion milliners of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Like many other purveyors of luxury specialties, the firm's success led to expansion into other fashion items.  The overall shape and angular insertions in this elegant evening scarf manifest the geometric aesthetic of the Art Deco period.  The technique of inserting the abstract design rather than applying it to the surface is more labor intensive, but gives a more refined and flat finish.",
