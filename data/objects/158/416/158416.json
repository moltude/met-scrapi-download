    "description": "As most sets of matching dress accessories from the mid 19th century have become separated over time, this one is prized for its completeness.  The undersleeves were worn so that the lace and ruffles extended below the sleeve ends for a more finished look. The set could be interchanged with different  dresses , serving to expand the variety in a woman's wardrobe.",
