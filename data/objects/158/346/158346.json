    "description": "This dalmatic and maniple present a beautifully crafted and ornate example of an ecclesiastical vestment. The embroidery of the saints is artfully rendered: the facial features, skin tones, hair, and such fine details as the definition of the fingers, are executed so delicately as to be mistaken for painted work. Ecclesiastical garments were meant to contribute to the sense of mystery and awe associated with worship; this opulent dalmatic exemplifies that custom. This dalmatic and maniple are part of a set that includes a cope (2009.300.3410), a two chasubles (2009.300.2949 and 2009.300.2952a\u2013c) and a second dalmatic (2009.300.3411a, b).",
