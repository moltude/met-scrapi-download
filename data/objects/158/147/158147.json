    "description": "The intriguing diamond decorations with creative pleated velvet centers make this evening cape memorable.  The concept of incorporating a full jacket with an overcape is drawn from the 19th-century Inverness cape, once again following the House of Worth's predilection for looking to the past for fashions of the present.  Jean-Charles Worth joined the House of Worth around 1910 and became chief designer after World War I when his uncle, Jean-Philippe Worth, retired.  He transitioned the Worth style into a new era of simpler lines and silhouettes with minimal trim indicative of the 1920s and 30s.  He also moved the House into the more practical styles reflecting the decrease in noble patrons.  Jean-Charles retired in 1935, passing the design reins to his nephew, Roger Worth.Roger Worth began designing for the House of Worth in 1935 at the time of his uncle, Jean-Charles Worth's, retirement.  He continued his uncle's legacy of simple lines but included small amounts of elaborate trimmings which his great-grandfather, Charles Frederick Worth, had used continuously, such as lace, beadwork embroidery and creative effects with the fabric itself.  Despite his efforts, the old house was troubled through the war years and never fully recovered before being purchased by the House of Paquin in 1954.  The house was subsequently closed two years later when all attempts to revitalize were ceased.",
