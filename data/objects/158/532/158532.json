    "description": "Marie-Blanche di Pietro began designing for the House of Lanvin when her mother, Jeanne Lanvin, died in 1946.  Although she only designed for the couture branch for four years before hiring Antonio Canovas del Castillo, she quickly carried the elegance that her mother had laid out for the company since its inception.  The visual appeal of this particular evening dress comes from the symmetry being created between the flared shoulder straps and hem.  In addition the complex construction used to create the gathered bodice and knotting drapery at the back is flawlessly executed and indicative of the quality of the House of Lanvin.  Marie-Blanche was photographed wearing three rhinestone bow brooches similar to the ones on this garment around 1950 making it one of her signature styles.",
