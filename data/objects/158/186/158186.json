    "description": "In a play on the concept of the bronzed baby shoe, this single ankle-strap shoe uses an untraditional material to amusing effect.  By stylizing the basic form with a widened strap and platform sole, the shoe's designer has bestowed an explicitly humorous tone to the strangely logical, albeit atypical, choice of metallic leather.  The bronzing of baby shoes became a well known practice in the 1930s and expanded greatly in the post-war period.  The designer of this shoe has created a witty conundrum:  shall the already \"bronze\" baby shoe be bronzed?  Further, if the bronzed baby shoe is a preserved memory, is this shoe then a purchased memory, complete without ever being worn?   This shoe was saved by the footwear designer Margaret Clark of Margaret Jerrold, Inc., who may have appreciated its ironic overtones.",
