    "description": "In this attractively detailed design from the Osgood collection, topstitching is brought to the fore as a decorative element.  Each seam features double rows of stitching in two weights of threads, with the finer threads in a smaller stitch outlining the heavier.  An overlay on the quarters provides opportunity to expand the decorative program to an impressive twelve rows of stitching.  Despite its noteworthy abundance, the stitchwork is nicely scaled so as not to overwhelm the design.  The range of leather colors and finishes expanded in 1950s, reflecting a more youthful and individualistic sensibility.  The oxblood color seen here was a standard but less common color for menswear.",
