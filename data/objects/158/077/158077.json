    "description": "Textiles, motifs and designs of Callot garments draw on multi-cultural sources, always in a subtle and refined manner. In this example, Madame Gerber's design features a Chinese-inspired damask and the distinctive horse-hoof cuffs of a Chinese Imperial robe. These elements are combined with a Western menswear-inspired collar treatment, trimmed with black satin for contrast.  The alignment of the textile across the seams, especially in the sleeves, and the double-roll collar are additional hallmarks of couture construction in this garment.",
