    "description": "Schiaparelli often used her accessories, particularly belts, as avenues of expression for her Surrealist ideals. Buckles, clasps, decorations and belts themselves were made of unusual materials, such as plastic and plaster, and in quirky shapes that could elicit a viewer\u2019s double-take. To pair such an off-beat accessory with a couture garment was just the kind of humorous irony Schiaparelli enjoyed incorporating into her work. Using bright colors and festive tassel decoration, this belt is an example of Schiaparelli's whimsical design aesthetic. The folkloric-inspired aura of the belt is carried out in the scrollwork buckle and the braid decoration, reminiscent of Tyrolean belts.",
