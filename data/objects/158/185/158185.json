    "description": "Acclaimed for the artistry and originality of its head designer, Mme. Jeanne Paquin, the House of Paquin was arugably the  pre-eminent house of couture during the Belle \u00c9poque. In this costume, the interest and originality is in the bodice, which is both draped and tailored, giving an ambiguity of form between a soft jacket and a tailored blouse. To combine tailoring and draping in the same piece at this early date was prescient, for within ten years women were more active and in need of clothing that would take them from day into evening.",
