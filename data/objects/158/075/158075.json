    "description": "Although the specific origins of this scarf are unidentified, the coloration and patterning shows the merging of influences between Western Europe and Islam. The defining features include brilliant colors in both brocaded flowers and weft and Western lace motifs combined with a complex pattern that incorporates the tassel motif common in traditional folk patterns--and here evocative of the Turkish tulip form. The scarf was given to the collection by Millicent Rogers, who not only amassed a notable collection of haute couture garments, she also collected folkloric clothing and accessories for her own use.",
