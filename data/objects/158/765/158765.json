    "description": "Norman Norell is credited as the father of American high fashion, an accolade well-deserved for a long career which established the country's fashion industry and made way for other great designers such as Bill Blass, James Galanos, and Halston. In 1941, after years of working with another fashion icon, Hattie Carnegie, Norell partnered with Anthony Traina to form Traina-Norell where he began to receive recognition for his designs. In 1960 Norell founded his own label, Norman Norell Ltd., where his reputation became equal to that of French designers of the time. Norell's style consisted of sophisticated and luxurious garments executed in a relaxed manner. Especially notable are his sequined evening sheaths which remain classic and beautiful in their simplicity.",
