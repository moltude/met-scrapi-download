    "description": "A well-documented example, this corset perfectly illustrates the understructure required to accomplish the dominant S-curve silhouette of the time. It was purchased at the well-known Parisian department store Au Bon March\u00e9 in 1904. The front-lacing, as opposed to the usual back lacing, is highly unusual for this period. It became a more popular feature for corsets later in the 20th century, as it allowed a woman to put on and adjust the corset by herself.",
