    "description": "Historically favored for babies, two-tone shoes rose in importance as an adult style in the late 1910s and were fairly common in the 1920s.  Button boots had been an important adult style until the 1920s, but by the end of the decade had gone out of style, only to reappear periodically as a \"revival\" style.  The button style persisted for babies, however, long after the adult style had fallen into disuse. This pair of attractive two-tone button boots features a silk tassel, an element which is both less common and less frequently preserved,  as they were easily detached and lost.",
