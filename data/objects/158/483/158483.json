    "description": "Millicent Rogers, the original owner of this belt, was a stylish woman who strove to express herself not only in her collections of art, jewelry and houses, but also in the clothing she wore. She also worked tirelessly during World War II to supply Allied troops with medical supplies as the founder and Executive Chairman of the Medical and Surgical Relief Committee.  She opened her home in Virginia, \"Claremont Manor,\" to rehabilitate war-shocked and injured Naval soldiers from 1942-45.  As many Americans did during WWII, she wore clothing that indicated her support of the American troops, such as this belt, emblazoned with insignias representing various military units such as 91st Infantry Division and the Armored Division.",
