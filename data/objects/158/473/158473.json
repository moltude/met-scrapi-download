    "description": "Schiaparelli often used her accessories, particularly belts, as avenues of expression for her Surrealist ideals. Buckles, clasps, decorations and belts themselves were made of unusual materials, such as plastic and plaster, and in quirky shapes that could elicit a viewer\u2019s double-take. To pair such an off-beat accessory with a couture garment was just the kind of humorous irony Schiaparelli enjoyed incorporating into her work. In Surrealism, marine motifs such as shells, crustaceans and fish abound.  A subtle example of that practice is this belt, owned by Millicent Rogers. The detailed seashell forms that, together with the gilt metal hook, act as the fastener are beautifully and intricately made. The shells are made of composition, a material Schiaparelli often experimented with in her closures and an example of her desire to seek out new and exciting materials. The adjustability of the gilt metal hook and eye is unique, exemplar of Schiaparelli's artistic flair.",
