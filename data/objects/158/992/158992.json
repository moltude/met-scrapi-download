    "description": "Madeleine Vionnet was a consummate technician, particularly known for her innovative use of the bias cut and the mathematically precise construction of her garments. Minimalist by philosophy, Vionnet's construction details were often executed so as to create decorative effects, obviating the need for any trimming. This evening ensemble displays a wonderful use of tonal colors. Vionnet's handling of the bodice panels shows her signature economy of seaming and complex cut.",
