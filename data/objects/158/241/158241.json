    "description": "The firm of Mark Cross was founded in 1845 as a saddle and harness maker, but shifted to luxury leather goods and accessories as the automobile began to replace the horse.  Everything about this umbrella expresses high quality and refinement: the angled end of the elegantly simple crook handle, the exaggerated size and the curved shape of the rib tips, the ivory and gilt fittings, the silk cover with self-finished edge, and the smooth, slender mechanism.  The final statement of its luxury status is the gold monogram mount on the handle.",
