    "description": "Jacques Doucet was first, and foremost, a connoisseur of art.  Additionally, his passion for the refined and exquisite overflowed into his dealings with fashion, making him one of the finest French couturiers during the Belle \u00c9poque.  The House of Doucet began as a family business, specializing in women's lingerie and laces, as well as articles of clothing for men.  Founded in 1817, the company rose to fame under the hand of Jacques.  The house was known for its luxurious offerings, which were worn and coveted by royalty, members of the elite society in both Europe and America, and actresses of the stage.This is an exquisite ball gown of the period that exemplifies the fine work produced by the French ateliers. The placement of the paillettes into bee forms is a particularly engaging aspect of the overall embroidery and design, accenting the detailed ribbon work.  The garland of bows and flower buds enhance the hem of the skirt and the bodice, making this a delicate and romantic masterpiece.",
