    "description": "The Osgood collection comprises 179 objects, chiefly fashionable Italian-made women's shoes dating from the years 1954 to 1958.  The shoes were collected by Charline Osgood, Director of the Kid Leather Guild, a trade organization of American kid leather manufacturers.  Highlighting the use of kid leather in footwear, the collection provides a fascinating and enticing view of high-style European shoe design from the period, representing many of the finest and most inventive Italian makers.The low quarters and upturned toe on this sample resemble Turkish or Perian slippers.  The extreme low cut gives a naked look which Osgood pointed out as an important contemporary trend.  Two new colors in leather,  \"Tanny Beige\" (upper) and \"Sweetpea\" (lining) are featured.",
