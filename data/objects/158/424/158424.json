    "description": "The low tie was the dominant style of man's shoe in the mid 19th century. These dressy black patent shoes are a modified version of the latchet tie style of the previous century, with their narrow latchets secured through a single eyelet.  Multiple-eyelet shoes of the same basic cut, the predecessor of today's blucher, were in use at the time, but the more delicate latchet form is appropriate to a shoe better suited to social entertainments than hard wear.  Patent leather was introduced into footwear in the 1790s, and its shiny surface has made it a popular choice for men\u2019s formal dress ever since.",
