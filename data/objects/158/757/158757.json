    "description": "Evening shoes were becoming increasingly bare in the 1920s, although open toes and sandal vamps would not become common for another decade.  This French example of the classic T-strap is particularly refined and delicate, displaying the highest workmanship.  The shoes were custom made in colored material as opposed to standard practice of brush dyeing a pair of white shoes.  While tiny rhinestone buttons or buckles were a common feature of the better examples of the period, the fact that the rhinestone button is colored to match the upper in this pair indicates the degree of attention to detail and quality.",
