This interest in using museum objects for contemporary creative design endeavors was the original mission behind collecting textiles and costumes for the Industrial Design Department of the Brooklyn Museum, and was the motivating force behind the creation of the Design Lab through the work of Stewart Culin and M.D.C. Crawford.",
