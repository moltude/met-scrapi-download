    "description": "Sylvia Pedlar was a renowned American lingerie designer in the mid-20th century.  She regularly updated historic forms to create her luxurious nightwear and lingerie.  The toga form was one of her earliest and most outstanding designs which she continued to use and change throughout her design career.  This example is very avant garde not only in its simplicity of cut, but in its bright, almost psychedelic patterning which presages the era of the 1960s.",
