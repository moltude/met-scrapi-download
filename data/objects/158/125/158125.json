    "description": "The Osgood collection comprises 179 objects, chiefly fashionable Italian-made women's shoes dating from the years 1954 to 1958.  The shoes were collected by Charline Osgood, Director of the Kid Leather Guild, a trade organization of American kid leather manufacturers.  Highlighting the use of kid leather in footwear, the collection provides a fascinating and enticing view of high-style European shoe design from the period, representing many of the finest and most inventive Italian makers.Osgood called this type of shoe a \"sweater pump\", ostensibly due to its tight, sexy style echoing the \"sweater girl\" look of the 1940s and '50s.  Strongly interested in improving the fit of American-made shoes, Osgood urged manufacturers in the U.S. to emulate the elasticized throat and general snugness of this model.",
