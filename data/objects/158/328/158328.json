    "description": "The \"Malette\" is a classic handbag made only by the prestigious Parisian firm Herm\u00e8s. The bag was particularly favored by wealthy women in the 1950s and 1960s who, when traveling, could carry their fine jewelry with them. For added security, the model has a separate locked jewelry compartment in the bottom with two separate locks and key sheath containing keys for each. This example, which was owned by Barbara \"Babe\" Paley and donated to the Brooklyn Museum of Art by her social secretary, serves as an example of the luxurious items made by Herm\u00e8s with the finest materials and superlative craftsmanship. Even the placement of the skin has been carefully planned and matched to create a product of the highest quality. A \"Malette\" bag of this vintage is viewed and collected as an objet d'art in its own right, while the provenance of this particular piece gives it further significance.",
