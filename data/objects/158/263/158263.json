    "description": "Perhaps what makes this child's jacket most interesting is the trim, which is meant to simulate ermine.  In Europe, ermine was a symbol of royalty, used mostly on winter coats and also on the ceremonial robes of the House of Lords.  Real ermine on childrenswear was particularly popular in the 1890s, this jacket being a precursor to that trend.  Overall, this piece illustrates the enduring enchantment with ermine and its associations.",
