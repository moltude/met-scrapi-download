    "description": "This is an early form of the leisure suit, composed of a loose fitting jacket originally known in England as a \"lounge jacket\" and straight-legged pants.  The style was introduced in the 1860s to be worn casually on a country retreat or for sporting activities.  It was favored because it gave the appearance of a suit while being less constricting due to its soft material and basic construction.  The style was later popularized by King Edward VII (1841-1910) before he was King.",
