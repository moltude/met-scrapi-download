    "description": "Through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, men\u2019s fashion, especially footwear,  has tended to be more staid and less subject to rapid or extreme fluctuations than has women\u2019s.  Traditional views of masculinity discourage excessive interest in fashion, men's styles evolve more slowly, and the male wardrobe need not be extensive to be complete.  Men therefore tend to have fewer clothes and wear them for a longer period, making shoes that survive in excellent condition particularly scarce.  This pair of classic men\u2019s early 20th century boots was saved as a manufacturer\u2019s sample, so remains in original unworn condition.  Of particular note on these boots in the interesting variation in perforation sizes and the square throat line.",
