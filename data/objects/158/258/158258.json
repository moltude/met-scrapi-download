    "description": "The dress is a transitional style from the style of the late teens into the tubular knee-length dresses of the 1920s.  Although it exudes wealth, it is very different from the more traditional styles which had been offered by the House from its inception.  The paillette design is remarkably executed and engaging.Jean-Charles Worth joined the House of Worth around 1910 and became chief designer after World War I when his uncle, Jean-Philippe Worth, retired.  He transitioned the Worth style into a new era of simpler lines and silhouettes with minimal trim indicative of the 1920s and 30s.  He also moved the House into the more practical styles reflecting the decrease in noble patrons.  Jean-Charles retired in 1935, passing the design reins to his nephew, Roger Worth.",
