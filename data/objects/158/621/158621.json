    "description": "Throughout his career, Christian Dior produced gowns which were worn by women in the public eye, from royals to First Ladies to Hollywood stars. If a woman wanted a gown that was both fashionable, attractive and unfailingly \"correct,\" she sought out Dior. This gown, from Dior's final collection, demonstrates his feminine and regal design sensibility, from the floor-length full skirt to the turned back collar that would grace the wearer's collarbone and three-quarter length sleeves that allowed her to show off her jewelry.",
