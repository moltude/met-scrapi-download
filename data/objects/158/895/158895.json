    "description": "Beth Levine's ingenious and witty designs, experimentation with novel materials, and ability to invent practical solutions have earned her the place of top female shoe designer of the 20th century. Levine was particularly adept at predicting future trends and devising structural innovations. Chief among her achievements were the popularization of the fashion boot in the 1960s, the use of vinyl and spandex, and the inventions of the Spring-o-lator mule, the stocking shoe, and the topless shoe. These boundary-breaking innovations earned Levine a Coty award 1967.Levine used surrealist imagery, including plastic grass, race cars, and sports equipment, in several of her well known designs.  \"Kick Off\" is a whimsical adaptation of a football in to a sporty shoe.",
