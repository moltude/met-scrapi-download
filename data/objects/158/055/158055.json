    "description": "While the lovingly embroidered baby caps and christening gowns and adorably diminutive booties of infants are preserved in great quantity, garments for older children seldom survive in a good state or preservation.   This scarce pair of 18th century child\u2019s shoes incorporates the pointed toe and tongue found in fashionable women's styles, combined with the flat heel suitable for a child.  It is not clear from the cut whether these shoes would have been worn by a boy or a girl, but the bright color is more suggestive of feminine dress.",
