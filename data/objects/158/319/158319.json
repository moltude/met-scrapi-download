    "description": "The sailor suit came in many dress versions, making it appropriate for any time of day and any season.  It was a hugely popular style for boys because it expressed patriotism and pride in the male child.  These variations were extremely popular for boys in the late-19th and early-20th century.  The Prince of Wales was painted by Winterhalter in 1846 wearing a sailor suit, which initiated its wide popularity and continued unabated through the mid-20th century.  Also interesting to note, the great American designer Norman Norell channeled his aesthetic from a sailor suit that he had fond memories of wearing as a boy.",
