    "description": "The classic Art Deco floral pattern seen here makes this stole unique.  This popular design movement, beginning in 1925 and lasting until 1939, affected both decorative and visual arts.  Very geometric, the Art Deco designs and motifs were influenced by a variety of sources, among them being the arts of Africa, Ancient Egypt and Aztec Mexico.  The floral geometric pattern is a visual testament to this.  Also of interest, is the refined nuanced dying technique applied to the silk and the ombr\u00e9 stripes at center.",
