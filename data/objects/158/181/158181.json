    "description": "This pair of Kayser gloves is a nice representation of fine quality evening accessories of the period.  They are unique because they are unworn and have all of their original tags from the retailer and manufacturer, including the price which indicates the late 19th-century cost of this type of luxury good.  Julius Kayser & Co. was a manufacturer of women's accessories, primarily known for its lingerie.  The retailer, Stern Brothers Department Stores, was originally on the Ladies Mile, a portion of Broadway between Eighth and Twenty-third streets, and was known for its luxury goods.",
