    "description": "Der Weisskunig (the white king) is a loosely biographical account of the life of Emperor Maximilian I. The text, composed by Maximilian's secretary Marx Treitz-Sauerwein, is accompanied by illustrations by Burgkmair, as well as Leonhard Beck, Hans Sch\u00e4ufelein, and Hans Springinklee, with proofs completed between 1514\u201316. However, they remained unpublished until the blocks were rediscovered in 1775, at which point they were published as a book in Vienna by Hoffst\u00e4tter. The first edition was published again in 1799 by S. Edward in London with the French title, \"Tableaux des principaux ev\u00e9nemens de la vie et du regne de l'empereur Maximilien I.\" This edition includes 236 woodcut illustrations.",
