    "description": "Pu Ru, brother of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi, was the most talented painter among the princes of the Qing royal family. After the fall of the dynasty, Pu Ru took degrees in astronomy and biology in Berlin and then taught in the late 20s at the Imperial University in Tokyo. Returning to China, he taught at the National Art Academy in Peking, the art college within Peking University.Pu Ru never departed from the refined painting style acquired in his early training, but his paintings were nonetheless distinctive and original. This flower fan with its delicate, tightly controlled brushwork and pretty colors reveals his genteel sensibilities, as do the well-crafted poems in the old style, both of which refer to pure worlds of unsullied beauty.",
