    "description": "This painting is Wang Hui\u2019s second earliest extant work. Done barely two years into his apprenticeship under the preeminent master Wang Shimin (1592\u20131680), it shows an approach that differs entirely from that of his earliest known work of 1650 and reflects his exposure to the region\u2019s great collections of ancient masters.According to Wang\u2019s inscription, the painting follows the style of Zhao Boju (died ca. 1162), a Southern Song academy painter known for his landscapes in the blue-and-green style. The calligraphic contour lines and texture dots of Wang\u2019s interpretation, however, owe more to Wang Shimin than to the twelfth-century master.One year before his death Wang added a second inscription:This painting was done in my youth; suddenly, more than sixty years have gone by. Seeing it now I am ashamed of my first steps.",
