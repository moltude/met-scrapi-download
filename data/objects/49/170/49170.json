    "description": "Shitao, born Zhu Ruoji, a scion of the Ming imperial family, escaped death in his youth by taking refuge in the Buddhist priesthood. In 1662 he became a disciple of the powerful Chan (Zen) master L\u00fc\u2019an Benyue (d. 1676). In the late 1660s and 1670s, while living in seclusion in temples around Xuancheng, Anhui Province, he taught himself to paint. In The Sixteen Luohans, Shitao\u2019s earliest major extant work, the young painter, then twenty-five, drew what are possibly the most effective figures since the Yuan period (1279\u20131368). A rare religious subject for Shitao, known for his visionary landscapes, the scroll depicts the sixteen guardian luohans (saints) ordered by the Buddha to live in the mountains and protect the Buddhist law until the coming of the future Buddha. Stylistically, the immediate sources for Shitao\u2019s figures were late Ming painters, such as Ding Yunpeng (1547\u2013ca. 1621) and Wu Bin (act. ca. 1583\u20131626). Unlike Wu Bin\u2019s luohans, which seem to be merely grotesque caricatures, Shitao\u2019s are carefully observed, showing such thoroughly human qualities as humor and curiosity.",
