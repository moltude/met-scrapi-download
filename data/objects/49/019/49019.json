    "description": "Known as the last major Zhe School professional painter, the Hangzhou artist Lan Ying was sufficiently influenced by late Ming scholar-painting aesthetics to have devoted most of his creative energy to painting in the idioms of the Song and Yuan masters. In this self-titled work, for example, Lan invokes the theme of life in reclusion celebrated in many paintings by Yuan scholar-artists.Unlike the works of the Wu School scholar-painters, however, Lan Ying\u2019s paintings emphasize technical virtuosity and coloristic effects. Lan\u2019s expressive drawing and bold use of color influenced a number of younger painters, including Chen Hongshou (1598\u20131652).",
