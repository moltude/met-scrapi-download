    "description": "When a pharaoh decided to build a temple, a foundation ceremony was performed during which the outlines of the building were marked by cords stretched over wooden pegs. At certain places along the circumference or the axis of the future building holes were dug in the ground into which the king placed votive objects.      Many of the objects placed in foundation deposits were tools used for construction of the building or of the shrines and statues to be housed within it. Some tools, such as this brick cradle, were models; others were full-size, usable tools (see 96.4.7).",
