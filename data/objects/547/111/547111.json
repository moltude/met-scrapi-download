    "description": "Even in the earliest graves, everyone was buried wearing their favorite ornaments. Jewelry was simple: necklaces, bracelets, and anklets. Amulets, semi-diadems (forehead ornaments), and belts occasionally occur. Jewelry often provided protection through its shape, material, and color; some pieces conferred status through type or material. This necklace was found with the burial of a child, along with a number of other luxury and prestige items (see 09.182.1-.8). Clearly the child was born into a wealthy and powerful family, and acquired his or her status through birth.",
