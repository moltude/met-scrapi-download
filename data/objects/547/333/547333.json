    "description": "This beaded belt was found wound around the waist of a man. It is one of only six Badarian belts known. All were worn by men, suggesting that belts were a male preogative. Several colossal statues of the fertility god Min demonstrate how such a belt was worn, but interestingly, no belts are currently known from the period between the Badarian and the end of the Predynastic Period, the date of the Min statues. Perhaps beads were replaced by linen or leather, which have not survived.",
