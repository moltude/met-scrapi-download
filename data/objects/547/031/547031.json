    "description": "Cosmetic containers made of wood, bone, or ivory must have been used for storing fairly dry substances such as powder or rouge. This little box consists of a hollowed round lower part with two squared protrusions, one at the back and one at the front. The shape of the flat lid follows that of the box, but its circular central part is smaller than the lid and covers only the container's cavity. A peg inserted through the rear protrusions of the lid and box serves as a swivel pin for the lid, while a knob on the protrusion at the front of the box once corresponded to a now-missing knob on the front part of the lid. As usual for such containers, a string wound around the two knobs fastened the two pieces together. On the upper surface of the lid a flower petal design surrounded by a zigzag circle is incised. The incised lines of the floral motif must have been made with the help of a compass. They are filled with Egyptian blue.",
