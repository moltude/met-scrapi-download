    "description": "This well-made pair of palm-leaf sandals for an infant is similar in style (with a thong emerging between the big and second toes and an ankle strap) to forty-one single sandals and two pairs found at Kellis (modern Ismant al-Kharab) in Dakhla Oasis, though the Museum\u2019s pair has pointed rather than square toes. Palm footwear was traditional in Egypt, and palm-leaf soles, such as those seen here, are frequently seen on children\u2019s and smaller-sized adult sandals.",
