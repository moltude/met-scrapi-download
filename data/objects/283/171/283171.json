    "description": "This portrait by an as yet unidentified photographer conveys the dignity and exquisite sensitivity of the sitter. Delicately tinted in watercolor, the image is housed in an album with forty-seven other portraits and genre studies from China; neatly captioned in French, these are obviously the work of a single photographer. Unlike the depersonalized types usually found in such a collection, these portraits--be they of soldiers, young women, prosperous merchants, or old beggars--display the same remarkable understanding of and empathy with their subjects. They were probably bought as a group by a discriminating tourist in China in the 1870s. Photographs of Japan were mounted on the verso of each album page.",
