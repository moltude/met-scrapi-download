    "description": "Here we see the photographer\u2019s husband posed as Tennyson\u2019s Merlin, the magician whose purity was the wellspring of his power, and an unidentified woman playing the harlot Vivien, who enchants him. Mr. Cameron stands before \u201cthe hollow oak\u201d (carried in from Tennyson\u2019s property), \u201clost to life and use, and name and fame.\u201d The picture succeeds through the language of gesture: Vivien\u2019s turning, pointing attitude (which Cameron aptly termed \u201cpiquante\u201d) and Merlin\u2019s dreamlike trance make this the image incarnate of the casting of a spell.",
