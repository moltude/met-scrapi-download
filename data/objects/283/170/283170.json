    "description": "An adventurous officer hailing from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Baron Raimund von Stillfried-Rathenitz was a painter and photographer who at times served as a diplomat and reporter; he set up a photographic studio in Japan in 1872. Hugely successful, Stillfried bought Felice Beato's establishment in 1877 and taught several of the first generation of Japanese photographers, bequeathing his operation to the most gifted of them, Kusakabe Kimbei, in 1885.     Stillfried's portraits and genre scenes are a continuation of Beato's studies of the country's traditional ways. Imbued with a sentimental charm, they catered to Westerners' insatiable appetite for things Japanese and satisfied the increasing demand by tourists for images of a timeless Japan. Stillfried's pictures nevertheless reveal a country moving toward Westernization. Whereas Beato's samurai was a warrior who exuded the pride and disciplined ferocity of his caste, Stillfried's samurai is actually an actor. He wears the martial trappings of a feudal class abolished in the early years of the Meiji Restoration (1868). Following Beato's practice of coloring photographs to please local taste, Stillfried had the image heavily tinted, probably by a painter attached to the photographic studio solely for that purpose.     The picture is one of a group of forty-eight images that offer a rather conventional sampling of Japanese characters and genre scenes by various photographers. Roughly captioned in English, they were inserted into an elegant album of Chinese photographs captioned in French (see no. 109b).",
