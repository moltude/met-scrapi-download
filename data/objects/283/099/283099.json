    "description": "On February 21, 1866, Cameron wrote to Henry Cole, director of the South Kensington Museum, \u201cI have been for 8 weeks nursing poor Philip Worsley on his dying bed. . . . The heart of man cannot conceive a sight more pitiful than the outward evidence of the breaking up of his whole being.\u201d An Oxford-educated poet who translated the Odyssey and part of the Iliad into Spenserian verse, Worsley died of tuberculosis at the age of thirty the following May. Cameron\u2019s portrait, made the year of his death, vividly conveys the intensity of Worsley\u2019s intellectual life and something of its tragedy. To her subject\u2019s hypnotic gravity she added intimations of sacrifice, engulfing the dying poet in dramatic darkness.",
