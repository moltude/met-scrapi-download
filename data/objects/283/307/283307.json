    "description": "Furuya obsessively documented myriad aspects of his life with Christine G\u00f6ssler, from their meeting in 1978 to her suicide in 1985.  Since then, the artist has embarked on a quixotic, seemingly infinite reconfiguration of the sea of images that survive his subject.  Like a writer mulling over his material, Furuya coaxes clues out of the unanswerable questions of human suffering and experience. In this pairing the end of a story (on the contact sheet) is written into its opening lines, prefigured in the scars that haunt the flush of first love.",
