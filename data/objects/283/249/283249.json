    "description": "Adolph de Meyer's portrait of Lady Ottoline Morrell, eccentric hostess to Bloomsbury, is a stunning summation of the character of this aristocratic lady who aspired to live \"on the same plane as poetry and as music.\"   Rebelling against the narrow values of her class, Lady Ottoline Cavendish Bentinck (1873-1938) married Philip Morrell, a lawyer and liberal Member of Parliament, and surrounded herself in London and on their estate at Garsington with a large circle of friends, including Bertrand Russell, W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence, T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, Lytton Strachey, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, and E. M. Forster. Tall, wearing fantastic, scented, vaguely Elizabethan clothes, Lady Ottoline made an unforgettable impression. With her dyed red hair, patrician nose, and jutting jaw, she could look, according to Lord David Cecil, at one and the same moment beautiful and grotesque. Henry James saw her as \"some gorgeous heraldic creature--a Gryphon perhaps or a Dragon Volant.\"      De Meyer made several portraits of Lady Ottoline. None went as far as this one in conjuring up the sitter's flamboyant persona, capturing, through dramatic lighting and Pre-Raphaelite design, her untamed, baroque quality. \"Her long, pale face, that she carried lifted up, somewhat in the Rossetti fashion, seemed almost drugged, as if a strange mass of thoughts coiled in the darkness within her.\"  D. H. Lawrence's inspired description of the character based on Lady Ottoline in \"Women in Love\" finds a vivid counterpart in the photographer's art.",
