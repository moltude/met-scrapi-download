    "description": "In a delicate interplay of form and decoration, the stark helmet-like shape of this toque is balanced with a single spectacular ornamental splash.  The stuffed bird of paradise is artistically arranged with dyed ostrich, presenting the bird as if nesting amongst green grass.  While the soft, flowing spray of the bird's tail is more in keeping with earlier taste, the dynamic tension created by the rather precarious positioning of the bird on the side of the crown and the resolute but controlled sweep of the brim are indicative of a more modern sensibility.",
