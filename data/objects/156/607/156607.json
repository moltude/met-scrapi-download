    "description": "In the 1910s, milliners began to move away from the huge, overblown, elaborate hats of the Edwardian era in favor of smaller and simpler designs.  More attention was paid to details of construction and form as well as new materials or new ways of using established materials.  Horsehair and lace were both common millinery materials, used to create filmy, transparent summer styles.  In this hat, however, they have been combined and reinterpreted in an unusual ornamental way.   This appealing model was sold by store in a fashionable shopping area of Brooklyn.",
