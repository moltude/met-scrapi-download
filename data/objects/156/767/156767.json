    "description": "This is an exemoplarp of the type of fan decoration  in which the variously shaped and formed sequins are combined to make up the design. Here there are flower heads, elliptical shapes, stars and ovals combined with regular round sequins that are combined, to give the appearance of foliate forms enclosed in geometric frames. The designer of this fan also makes good use of piqu\u00e9 work, or inlaid silver dots, in the sticks and guards. Piqu\u00e9 work was intended to imitate sequins and was a popular technique for adding additional sparkle in fan leaves and guards",
