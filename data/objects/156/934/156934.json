    "description": "A rare example made by the French glove manufacturer Pr\u00e9ville, these wedding gloves are noteworthy for their design. The leatherwork replicating a lace pattern at the cuffs is an unusual and refined touch. Only a very thin and soft kidskin would allow for the level of cutwork detail necessary to create the lace effect. The appearance of the finished gloves indicates the quality of the materials used to make them.",
