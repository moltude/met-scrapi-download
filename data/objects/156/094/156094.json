    "description": "This belt dates from the time Montana's popularity allowed him to found his own label in 1979.  The designer made an early name for himself with his production of leather goods.  The styling of this piece references his early training as a jewelry designer, recognized in the clever buckle ornament.  This belt is an early proponent of leather men's wear styles designed specifically for women.",
