This cocktail ensemble exhibits Valentina's inventive personality and her willingness to offer daring and unconventional designs. The bodice, in particular, shows quite a lot of skin for the 1930s, and also shows Valentina's talent for creating distinctive designs that were set apart from other designers of the time.",
