Originating as the style worn by British university students for sport and leisure activities on the water, it is also called a \"sailor,\" \"basher\" or \"skimmer\" in period accounts. The rich color and striking texture of this hat make it a particularly fine example from the Knox Hat Company that may have been made in the company's Brooklyn factory.",
