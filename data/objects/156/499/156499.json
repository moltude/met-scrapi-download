    "description": "Many of Schiaparelli's clients were women, who like Schiaparelli herself, were not beautiful in the conventional sense, but rather possessed a striking and unique quality. Schiaparelli's designs perpetuated that different type of artistic chic. In this particular coat, worn by devoted client Millicent Rogers, the dramatic asymmetric neckline and curved seaming add visual interest and lend a slightly off-center quality to the design. The beautifully crafted, high quality lion head buttons are animated, almost like a jewelry adornment. Rogers would have especially appreciated this detail, as she collected jewelry and made her own pieces as well.",
