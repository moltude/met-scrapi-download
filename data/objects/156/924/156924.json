    "description": "The corn husks and palm fronds decorating this casual summer hat emphasize the time of year in which it was worn. The incorporation of these seasonal materials is fanciful, as is common in hat design. The nature of millinery lends itself to whimsical and often extreme ornamentation. The use of genuine corn husks rather than artificial is a unique touch, adding to the overall quality of the piece.",
