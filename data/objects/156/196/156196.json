    "description": "Shoes dating from before the mid 18th century are scarce, especially in American museums, where they were usually purchased for the collection or given by  collectors, rather than surviving in the ancestral wardrobes of  museum donors.  Despite its poor condition, this pair of embroidered latchet tie shoes is a worthy item for the Brooklyn collection, providing an excellent example of the domed sole and exaggerated toe which typified high style ladies' shoes of the era.  The embroidered floral design, pleasingly rendered in complementary versions on the vamp and the heel, is typical of Stuart period embroidery.  The white leather rand (strip along the front of the sole), lining, and heel stitching demonstrate the quality construction and add an appealing element of contrast.",
