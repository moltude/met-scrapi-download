    "description": "Boots began to become fashionable for women in the last quarter of the 18th century, but their use was limited primarily to riding and driving.  This single boot displays the predominant front lace closure, diagonal top cut below the calf, and fashionable toe and heel shapes.  As their use was not particularly widespread and comparatively utilitarian, few examples of ladies' boots survive from the period.",
