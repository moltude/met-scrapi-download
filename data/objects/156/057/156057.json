    "description": "This dress is an excellent example of the flapper style that was established and popularized during the 1920s.  The silhouette displayed the youthful body, as skirts were raised and the waist was dropped.  It was common for young ladies to dance the night away doing the Charleston, the Shimmy and the Black Bottom, and the beading of this dress would have been eye-catching with such movement.  The intricate and artistic beadwork that is used is of the highest quality and an example of refined French workmanship from the period.  While the flapper style began as a style quite shocking, it developed into the look of the modern fashionable woman.",
