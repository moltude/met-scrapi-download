    "description": "The pierced decoration of the sticks on this fan is unusually detailed, refined and complex.  They were undoubtedly imported from China, where techniques for fine ivory carving had been practiced for centuries. The scenes of affectionate family life have a particular intimacy when depicted on a personal accessory. The still life imagery on the reverse leaf evokes Dutch still life paintings.",
