    "description": "The two-tone color scheme makes this a chic pair of gloves from the early 20th century.  These gloves were made by a French company whose products were patented in the United States and England.  The original owner of these gloves was Fernanda Wanamaker (1863-1900), wife of Lewis Rodman Wanamaker (1863-1928), who worked for his father's Philadelphia based department store chain, Wanamaker's, before taking over the company prior his father's death in 1922.  While working for his father at the New York branch of Wanamaker's, he provided luxurious French merchandise, such as these gloves, to the public.",
