    "description": "Collars this size have a strong presence and this scale is a good vehicle for large and dramatic lace designs such as this one. Notable in the design are the realistic depictions of four different flower varieties, including iris and tulips and the significant variation of grounds in the floral motifs which heightens the visual interest.  Laces composed of premade tapes such as this one were a less expensive version of their bobbin or needle-made counterparts, in this case Milanese type.",
