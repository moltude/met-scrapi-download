    "description": "An illustration of Schiaparelli's surreal sensibility, these gloves worn by Millicent Rogers are decorated with plastic discs reminiscent of chain mail armor or scales, and are both seductive and forbidding at the same time. Gloves were a perfect palette for Schiaparelli's more avant-garde, Surrealist designs, and often featured prominently in her collections. She designed gloves with red fingernails, blue veins and pairs of two different colors to be worn together. Rogers, a devoted client, was a willing participant in Schiaparelli\u2019s audacious and inventive design aesthetic, and almost 200 examples by Schiaparelli from her wardrobe reside in the Brooklyn Museum collection.",
