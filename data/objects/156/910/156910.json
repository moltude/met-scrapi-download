    "description": "Stockings, originally designed for practical purposes, soon transformed into a fashionable accessory with the invention of the knitting frame in 1589 and then the circular-knitting machine in 1816.  This technology allowed for a tighter weave and a better fit.  Also, it was much easier to produce stockings, making them more affordable and readily available to a larger public.  Plain white stockings were in mode for quite some time, until the mid to late-1800s when hemlines rose, and the ankle was revealed.  This change in fashion called for colorful and fanciful motifs to decorate the lower leg, a visually appealing effect.The colorful, striped patterning of this pair of stockings gives them a modern sensibility.  Overall, they have a sporty feel, yet their sheerness adds a touch of elegance.  It is very likely, that these would have been worn during the afternoon, appropriate for one of the sports of the day such as tennis or bicycling.",
