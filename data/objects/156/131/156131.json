    "description": "Hook, Knowles & Company was an upscale London firm whose clientele included the British royal family. On this pair of slippers, the novel beadwork design, the meticulously trimmed bow, and the topstitching of the heel are noteworthy indicators of the high quality.  The use of beadwork on the vamp and the tiered bow form are characteristic features of the period.  Bronze kidskin, produced by dyeing the leather with cochineal, came in and out of fashion for dressy women's shoes throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.",
