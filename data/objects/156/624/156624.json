    "description": "Valentina, the  Russian-born couturiere who worked in New York, created designs that incorporated drama with a special kind of chic elegance. She was adept at executing beautiful cuts using the finest of fabrics, here a lively broken chevron pattern in a rich navy silk. Valentina's skilled manipulation of fabric is evident in this garment, particularly in the construction of the sleeves, which are separate from the gown and are most likely constructed of one piece of fabric that has been folded and sewn into points. This gown was worn by Millicent Rogers, the fashion icon and Standard Oil heiress, herself a dramatic woman who chose only the most stylish clothing.",
