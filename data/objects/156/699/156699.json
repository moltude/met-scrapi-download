    "description": "Stockings, originally designed for practical purposes, soon transformed into a fashionable accessory with the invention of the knitting frame in 1589 and then the circular-knitting machine in 1816.  This technology allowed for a tighter weave and a better fit.  Also, it was much easier to produce stockings, making them more affordable and readily available to a larger public.  Plain white stockings were in mode for quite some time, until the mid to late-1800s when hemlines rose, and the ankle was revealed.  This change in fashion called for colorful and fanciful motifs to decorate the lower leg, a visually appealing effect.The rich navy blue color of this pair of stockings is particularly interesting, as well as the openwork design.  Extremely detailed, the pattern would have been quite flattering to see when revealed.  Dated to the period of the \"Naughty Nineties,\" the open spaces of the stockings are quite seductive and would have been very alluring to admirers.",
