    "description": "A classic Christian Dior cocktail dress from the mid-1950s, the abstract floral print of this dress takes the place of more elaborate applied trimming. The feminine bouffant silhouette shows Dior's continued commitment to \"The New Look\" which had made his debut collection a success in 1947. The genius of this design in its versatility; a matching blouse can be worn as an alternate bodice, transforming the cocktail look into lady-like day wear.",
