    "description": "One of a groupf of fifteen pairs dating from 1875 to 1906 by the firm of J. Ferry , these elegant evening slippers in a classic design and almost pristine condition illustrate the superb craftsmanship and attention to detail of the best Parisian footwear of the time.  The eye-catching topstitching emphasizes shape of heel and is one mark of the high quality.  The luxurious double bow of heavy satin ribbon is not merely stitched on, but ties through eyelets in the vamp. These shoes were in all likelihood made to match a dinner or evening dress.",
