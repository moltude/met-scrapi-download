    "description": "The pronounced sense of dynamism expressed by this hat was an important trend in millinery design in the 1910s.  Its dramatic form, with the oddly canted and asymmetric brim, is further emphasized by the long curling feather sprays, placed to increase the shape's spatial expansion by extending from the most extreme projections, and composed to give a jagged, explosive quality.  Sold in Brooklyn by the foremost department store at that time, this hat would have made a bold and stylish impression.",
