    "description": "The piecing and geometric form incorporated in the construction of this hat is representative of the transitional period at the end of the 1920s into the 1930s. Fashion moved towards a more sleek and streamlined silhouette. With the lengthening of hemlines, came the lengthening of the bobbed hair of the twenties. Glamour took precedence over the 1920s gamine, and a softer, more seductive and wavy hairstyle, or \"finger wave\", worn close to the head was favorable. The headwear of this period, incorporating draped fabric similar to the style of a turban, began to move towards a more form fitted shape that exposed the face.",
