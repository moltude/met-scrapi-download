    "description": "This gold mesh evening dress is of particular interest because of the cutwork effect found on the skirt and at the neck of the dress.  The beading stands out from the mesh background, appearing as if it were floating.  Specially made in France for the retailer, Stewart & Company, this dress is a well-crafted creation, epitomizing the spirit of the 1920s.",
