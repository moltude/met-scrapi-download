    "description": "Until the 1920s, the conventional women's sense of modesty dictated that the entire body should be covered.  Physical activities such as sea bathing were no exception, hence the inclusion of headwear in bathing costumes, as represented by this relatively early example for the Collection.   While the shape and decoration is not particularly distinct from everyday attire, as was typical of contemporary swimwear, the soft construction and playful but minimal trimming betray its function.",
