    "description": "In this lovely example of a toque, the subtly harmonizing fall tones and variety of trimmings are used to create exceptional visual interest.  The decorative scheme of leaves and berries is a departure from fussier floral trims, and suitable to the autumnal theme.  The slouchy tam shape of the crown was very popular in the later 1910s and early 1920s, and reflects the loose, baggy, boyish look seen in contemporary outerwear.",
