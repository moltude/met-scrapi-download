    "description": "The silk top hat became an essential component of the gentleman's wardrobe in the mid-19th century. During the reign of Queen Victoria in England, where this example was made, the gentleman who wore such a hat also followed a prescribed code of etiquette, such as raising or tipping the hat or touching the brim to acknowledge his social peers or superiors. Such attention to detailed social protocol also meant that hats made of silk plush, as this is, required frequent brushing to ensure the hat and the gentlemen looked polished at all times.",
