    "description": "Herman Delman (1895 -1955) is remembered as the great showman of the New York footwear industry. Targeting wealthy socialites and celebrities as his customers, Delman opened a small custom shoe shop on Madison Avenue in 1919. Gradually shifting his attentions to manufacturing, Delman hired top designers, most notably Roger Vivier, to create finely-crafted, chic and luxurious footwear in stand-out designs.  Delman was a savvy promoter who realized that product image was paramount. He pioneered the practice of featuring film stars in his advertisements and partnered with exclusive clothing stores, including Saks and Bergdorf Goodman, to distribute his shoes. Contrary to common practice, Delman insisted that his name appear in every shoe he manufactured, thus securing his company's reputation and success.  This evening shoe features the open sandal-like upper typical of the period in an elegant design and attractive color combination.",
