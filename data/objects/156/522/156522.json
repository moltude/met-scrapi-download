    "description": "The early 20th century was the heyday of millinery design, characterized by large and robustly trimmed hats.  The massive size and voluptuousness of design of this hat, with its intertwining of straw, raffia and ribbon as well as profusion of flowers, epitomize the period.  Materials of appropriate texture and bulk were carefully chosen to balance the scale in volume, contour, and detail.",
