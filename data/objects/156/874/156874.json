    "description": "This fan belonged to Amelia Beard Hollenback (1844-1918), wife of the prominent financier and philanthropist John Welles Hollenback (1835-1923). The fan was most likely part of Amelia's mourning wardrobe worn after the death of her closest sister, Julia Beard (1849-1887). Made up in the appropriate materials and dimensions of the late 1880s, women continued to follow the dictates of fashion even during mourning.",
