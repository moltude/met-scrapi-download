    "description": "One of the strongest millinery trends of the late 1930s and early 1940s, the so-called \"doll hat\" was distinguished only by its peculiarly small proportions.  Doll hats were usually worn perched on the forehead, and often provided with a back strap to hold them precariously in place.  This jaunty example was custom made at Hattie Carnegie, one of the most highly respected New York purveyors of tasteful womenswear. The form makes reference the sombrero cordob\u00e9s, and iconic Spanish style.  The attached snood was a common fashionable feature during this period, and echoes the long ribbon ties of the Cordoban hat.",
