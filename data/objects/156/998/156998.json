    "description": "The language of the Naval Reserve Act of 1916 stated that among those eligible to serve were \"all persons who may be capable of performing special useful service for coastal defense.\"  That lack of specificity allowed for the enlistment of women, who began to join the service in 1917. This naval reserve ensemble was worn by a Yeoman (F)--Yeoman (Female)--an enlisted rank popularly called Yeomanette. The rank predominantly involved secretarial and clerical work but could also include other duties such as recruiting, translating and designing. The last Yeoman (F) was reportedly discharged in 1921. It is likely that this uniform and that of a member of the American Legion (2009.300.220a\u2013d) were worn by the donor, Mrs. A. E. Laurencelle (n\u00e9e Ethel Redmond).",
