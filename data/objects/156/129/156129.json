    "description": "Paris was the unrivaled center for creative fashion design in the 19th and early 20th century, a fact no less true for millinery than garments.  The maker's creativity and originality shines through in this example in the combination of highly naturalistic lilacs with dexterously crafted abstract grapes.  The use of horsehair to create the grape forms provides an appealing connection to the masterfully draped body of the hat.",
