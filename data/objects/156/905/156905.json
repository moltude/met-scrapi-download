    "description": "The trend toward higher crowns for hats during the 1930s offered milliners an opportunity to revisit hat styles of earlier eras, including the beg\u00e8re style of the 1790s. A limited color palette makes the combination of textures a prominent element of this hat. Details of quality workmanship would have been expected by those shopping in Biarritz, a seaside resort favored by royals and the wealthy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
