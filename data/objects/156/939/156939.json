    "description": "The sobriety and frugality of the 1930s made the suit an essential element of female dress.  Feminized fedoras and other masculine-derived styles provided a tailored look that worked well with suits.  This well-made hat illustrates a typical incarnation of the type, and embodies the jauntiness of late 1930s styles. Feminized versions of mannish hats in this period frequently featured rich colors, tipped brims, and a somewhat high, close-fitting, tapered crown which was often finished at an angle.",
