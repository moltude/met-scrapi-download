    "description": "The transition from the high-heeled shoes of 18th century to flat 19th century styles is exemplified by this pair of delicately colored slippers.  The sharply pointed toe became fashionable in the later 1780s, and remained the preferred style for about twenty-five years as the heel diminished to nothingness.  Seen here is a classic example of the \"Italian\u201d heel; quite short with a deeply wedged seat, tapering sharply and flaring out to a tiny top piece.  The shoes are neatly trimmed in white, and beautifully burnished on the soles.",
