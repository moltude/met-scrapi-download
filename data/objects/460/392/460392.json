    "description": "The present pair of vases is thought to have been made in the eighteenth century, although a later date had also been suggested.(1) The current dating is based on similarities to other eighteenth-century works, including a hexagonal garniture (ca. 1760 \u2013 75), published in 2008 by Aronson, which also features polychrome chinoiserie decoration,(2) and an Imari jar of nearly identical form in the collection of the Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire, Brussels.(3)  Blue and white covered vases of the same form can also be seen as part of a garniture published in 2011 by Aronson.(4) Catalogue entry from Elizabeth Sullivan.
