    "description": "The scissorlike mechanism of this type of folding chair revolves around a central pin hinge that holds two opposed and interlocking sets of reverse-curved staves fitted into the armrests and runner bases. The chair can be folded up by disengaging the back that is pegged on one side to the arm and slotted at the other. Straight staves attached with three pins form the seat. The back is carved with a stylized heraldic device. It was constructed using two older (sixteenth-century) armrests. This chair is part of a group of related works in the Robert Lehman Collection. Whereas the type is customarily displayed without a cushion, to preserve the appearance of its stately stave construction many of the Lehman pieces received flat silk velvet decoration. The choice reflects a particular taste and documents the use of contemporary textiles as an important part of the collection concept. The term sedia a Savonarola, or \u201cSavonarola chair,\u201d derives from a work in the Museo Nazionale di San Marco, Florence, that traditionally belonged to Giacomo Savonarola.(1)  The model has a lighter design than the Dantesca type (see Nos. 161 \u2013 68) and, in most cases, is still foldable. Its appearance in many depictions of early Italian Renaissance interiors afforded the chair a special status. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the aesthetic effect of its simplicity of form and harmony of proportions contributed to its popularity with collectors. The chair was further appreciated for its role as a symbol of dignity in the antique manner, as attested by pictorial evidence (see Fig. 151.1).(2)  The seat was often reserved for the lord of the house or an eminent guest.(3)  Moreover, this fashionable Renaissance furnishing item may be seen in several depictions of the Annunciation.(4)  The model\u2019s iconic character is additionally supported by its prominent placement on a tin-glazed earthenware birth set of about 1525 \u2013 30, where a woman in labor is represented on such a seat.(5)Catalogue entry from: Wolfram Koeppe.
