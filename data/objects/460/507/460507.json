    "description": "As the model of the cup was in production at Nymphenburg at least from 1825,(1) dating is determined by the decoration. The view is of the Odeonsplatz, Munich, with the Felderrnhalle (built 1840 \u2013 44), a free copy of the fourteenth-century Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, in the center. At the right is the Theatinerkirche, which was begun in 1663, with the towers completed in 1690. Two other cups and saucers painted with views of Munich have been noted.(2)  Although differing slightly in model and decorative scheme, all appear to be contemporaneous.Catalogue entry from: Clare Le Corbeiller.
