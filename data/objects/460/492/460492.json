    "description": "This cassone was produced as a showpiece. The nail hinges are too weak to hold the heavy lid. In addition, the lid\u2019s overhanging, decorated with bent flute molding and partial gilding, was purposefully distressed in some areas to evoke the impression of generations of use and wear. The relatively small corner feet in the back contrast with the four massive claw foot elements of the display front, which is strongly curved outward. The claws appear to support four pilasters with fluting that is cabled in the lower third section. The form recalls carriage coffers held in position by leather straps.(1)  The off-center keyhole and the hollowedout space that likely held a now lost locking mechanism contribute to a Renaissance-like appearance. However, the style of the carving of the three front panels indicates without question a nineteenth- or early twentieth-century manufacture. Moreover, the construction reflects the work of cabinetmakers inexperienced with producing traditional chests. The small molding that frames the panels where they are bent or curved was not strong enough to withstand pressure and has deformed on almost all of the vertical sides. It seems unlikely that the piece was made in one of the great \u201crestoration workshops\u201d of dealers like Elia Volpi (1858 \u2013 1938) or Stefano Bardini (1836 \u2013 1922).(2)Catalogue entry from: Wolfram Koeppe.
