    "description": "The two associated chairs differ in small details. Each has S-curved arm supports and legs with a turned disk at the intersection; No. 161 has incised band edging at the front. The arms are shaped and decorated on the top with acanthus leaves, and end in volute hand pieces with carved rosettes at the side. The base rails are shaped on the underside and end in stylized claw feet (No. 161) or a gadroon and pearl pattern (No. 162). The embroidered blue silk velvet cushioned seat has green fringing; each back has an applied, embroidered cartouche. These two \u201cfolding armchairs\u201d are among the best preserved pieces of furniture in the Robert Lehman Collection and reflect the appreciation of the Italian Renaissance among American\u2019s wealthy elite during the last century and a half. The deliberate application of similar upholstery and embroidered parts helped unify the appearance of both chairs, and mask the differences in the woodwork, which can be detected only through close examination. On each, the disk that joins the two supports at the front and two more at the back suggests the possibility of folding up the seat, but this \u201cmechanism\u201d is deceptive, as any attempt to engage it would result in the supports colliding above the turning point. The X-shape, or sella curulis, or curule, derives from the ancient Roman seat primarily used by high officials.(1)  The form continued as the faldistorium through the Middle Ages, and then experienced enormous popularity among the affluent during the Renaissance in nearly all of Europe, which led to numerous imitations in the nineteenth century. Thornton illustrates a sechia of the Dantesca type, a term that was romantically applied to this specific form, as the name \u201cSavonarola\u201d was given to a second fashionable seat design.(2)  Covered with precious marquetry (see Nos. 159, 160) or elaborate upholstery with gilded decoration, the \u201cfossilized\u201d form, as Thornton called it, remained a symbol of power and riches well into the seventeenth century.(3)  Its importance is attested by its presence in portraits from this period and also by its inclusion in high feastday processions. The Opera by Bartolomeo Scappi of 1570 illustrates the rarely documented ceremony in which cardinals gathered in the conclave to select a new pope (see Fig. 161.1). Four \u201cprinces of the church,\u201d who preside at a table to control the access, are seated in similar \u201cfolding chairs\u201d as signs of their elevated status.(4)  It is nearly exclusively in noble palaces that such chairs are available not only to a royal host or guest but also to aristocratic visitors in recognition of their ranks.(5)  Various similar works have survived.(6)Catalogue entry from: Wolfram Koeppe.
