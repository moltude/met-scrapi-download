    "description": "The personal character of the decoration indicates a specific commission. The costume worn by the woman is earlier than the porcelain, dating to the mid-1850s; the portrait was thus probably copied for this commemorative purpose from a miniature or photograph. As identification of factory artists was rarely permitted, it is likely that Kaiser was an independent decorator.Catalogue entry from: Clare Le Corbeiller. The Robert Lehman Collection.
