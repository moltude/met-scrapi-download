    "description": "The two Dantesca-type chairs with S-curved arm supports and legs have been associated as a pair through the application of textile pieces with an identical repeat pattern. 1975.1.1975 a,b is carved on the arms with an overlapping nailed rosette motif; the hand pieces have carved rosettes; and a lion\u2019s mask is applied to the round intersection. There are carved leaf ornaments and stylized claw feet on the front. 1975.1.1976 a,b is molded on the curved arms and carved on the front with an interlaced band ornament; a large rosette decorates the intersection. The arms end in volute hand pieces with carved rosettes at the side. The base rails are shaped on the underside. See 1975.1.1971 a,b and 1975.1.1972. Catalogue entry from: Wolfram Koeppe.
