    "description": "The model is derived from Parisian silver and porcelain, the former evident in the rim moldings, knopped handles, and simulated gadrooning of the foot. The stylized character of the flowers is borrowed from the decoration of Saint-Cloud porcelain coolers of about 1730,(1) and an association with that factory is reinforced by a variant model(2) with identical floral ornament but with handles modeled as open-mouthed masks, also a typical Saint-Cloud conceit. The Rococo form of the model with its naturalistic handles recalls models produced at Vincennes from about 1745 to 1752.(3)  The brownish pink color of the material and somewhat rudimentary workmanship indicate one of the fai\u00ebnce fine manufactories outside Paris as the origin of these coolers, probably Lun\u00e9ville, which appears to have been the only active center for such production during this period. The two coolers differ considerably in appearance, No. 99 evidently having been cast from a worn mold and more heavily glazed. Catalogue entry from: Clare Le Corbeiller. The Robert Lehman Collection.
