    "description": "The traditional attribution to Germany of all enamel boxes with encrusted gold-foil decoration has recently come into question. The assignment arose from identification of the technique with the workshop established in Berlin by Pierre Fromery in which enamels \u2014 mostly small boxes \u2014 were decorated with pictorial subjects in a combination of foil and painting. The origin of the style is confirmed by numerous signed works.(1)  Perhaps related to the Berlin workshop, and of uncontested German attribution, is a group of boxes ornamented with geometric patterns in gold foil sometimes heightened with translucent enamel. Some boxes mounted with Parisian silver rims have been noted,(2) and the presence of either or both features has prompted an inclusive attribution to Germany of boxes like the present one,(3) but stylistic considerations have led to a reassessment.  It is not unlikely that unmounted enamel boxes should have been imported into Paris by marchands-merciers who would have had them fitted with silver rims, and argument for such a practice can be supported by the fact that no Parisian or other French enameling workshop has so far been identified. However, a watchcase in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, is decorated with foil encrustation signed by a craftsman, G. Bouvier, active in Paris about 1740;(4) this is certainly indicative of local activity on a commercial level. The decoration of the Lehman box and several others of its type(5) is conspicuous for an easy Rococo rhythm and grace, and the inclusion here of elegant military and musical trophies \u2014unusual in German decoration in this context\u2014 further encourages a French attribution.
