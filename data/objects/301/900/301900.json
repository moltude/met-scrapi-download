    "description": "In 1962 the kinetic sculptor Bury began a series of photobased works called \u201cCinetisations\u201d in which he cut photographs of architecture and works of art into thin strips that he reassembled to create compositions that appear to swerve, buckle, or collapse into themselves. In an interview in 1970, Bury explained, \u201cMy cinetised skyscraper reveals the slow-motion work of gravity. . . . The intervention in the image might seem to be a menacing desire to destroy, but we must see in it the wish to give an air of liberty to that which thinks itself immutable.\u201d He made this \u201ccinetisation\u201d of the Richard J. Daley Center, Chicago\u2019s tallest building from 1965 to 1969, when he was teaching in Chicago in the late 1960s.",
