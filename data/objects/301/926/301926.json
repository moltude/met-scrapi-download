    "description": "Mayne is celebrated for his hair-trigger vision of city life, especially photographs of children at play in the mean streets of London in the late 1950s. His grainy, dynamically composed pictures of pickup games,sidewalk ballet, and Teddy Boys and Mods on the prowl in bombed-out neighborhoods (declared uninhabitable and demolished by the end of the 1960s) were considered rude at the time but are now cherished by the British as bittersweet glimpses of a bygone era. This snapshot captures a defensive play by a lithe goalie in a street football game on Brindley Road in Paddington.",
