    "description": "Born Isabella Baumfree to a family of slaves in Ulster County, New York, Sojourner Truth sits for one of the war\u2019s most iconic portraits in an anonymous photographer\u2019s studio, likely in Detroit. The sixty-seven-year-old abolitionist, who never learned to read or write, pauses from her knitting and looks pensively at the camera. She was not only an antislavery activist and colleague of Frederick Douglass but also a memoirist and committed feminist, who shows herself engaged in the dignity of women\u2019s work. More than most sitters, Sojourner Truth is both the actor in the picture\u2019s drama and its author, and she used the card mount to promote and raise money for her many causes: I Sell the Shadow to Support the Substance. SOJOURNER TRUTH.The imprint on the verso features the sitter\u2019s statement in bright red ink as well as a Michigan 1864 copyright in her name. By owning control of her image, her \u201cshadow,\u201d Sojourner Truth could sell it. In so doing she became one of the era\u2019s most progressive advocates for slaves and freedmen after Emancipation, for women\u2019s suffrage, and for the medium of photography. At a human-rights convention, Sojourner Truth commented that she \u201cused to be sold for other people\u2019s benefit, but now she sold herself for her own.\u201d",
