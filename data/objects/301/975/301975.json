    "description": "This unusual horizontal carte de visite\u2014a period copy of a now-lost ambrotype or tintype\u2014shows Sergeant Alex Rogers proudly posing for the camera holding the scarred colors, or flag, of the Eighty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers. He and his fellow soldiers fought on virtually every Eastern battlefield and suffered the second highest number of battle deaths of any Union regiment. As seen here, infantry flags were large\u2014more than six feet in length\u2014and affixed to staffs almost ten feet tall that made them easy to rally around during the mess of battle. Their size, however, also made them targets for enemy fire and contributed to the high mortality rate of color bearers.",
