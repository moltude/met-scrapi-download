    "description": "In 1948 the Argentine women\u2019s magazine Idilio introduced a weekly column called \u201cPsychoanalysis Will Help You,\u201d which invited readers to submit their dreams for analysis. Each week, one dream was illustrated with a photomontage by Stern, a Bauhaus-trained photographer and graphic designer who fled Berlin for Buenos Aires when the Nazis came to power. Over three years, Stern created 140 photomontages for the magazine, translating the unconscious fears and desires of its predominantly female readership into clever, compelling images. Here, a masculine hand swoops in to \u201cturn on\u201d a lamp whose base is a tiny, elegantly dressed woman. Rarely has female objectification been so erotically and electrically charged.",
