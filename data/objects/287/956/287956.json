    "description": "Jane St. John was most likely attracted to photography through her close friendship with the Llewelyn family of Penllergare, who affectionately knew her as \"Aunt Jane.\" When she and her husband made an extended tour of Italy in 1856, she became an indefatigable photographer, documenting every stage of their journey as they made their way north from Naples, via Rome, Florence, Venice, and Como. On reaching Rome, she photographed all the main sights extensively and, perhaps growing tired of the city, found sanctuary on the grounds of the Villa Pamfili Doria, where groves of pine and ilex provided welcome shade. Caring little for pictorial convention, she set her camera low to the ground, knowing this unusual viewpoint would further dignify the stately pines.",
