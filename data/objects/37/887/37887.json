    "description": "While traveling, Krishna encounters the hunchbacked woman Trivakra and notices the wonderful ointments she made for the evil king Kamsa. Overcome by his presence, Trivakra offers the ointments to Krishna, who straightens her crooked back and transforms her into a perfectly proportioned, beautiful woman. The story illustrates Krishna\u2019s miraculous nature and Trivakra\u2019s devotion, which is ultimately manifest as her passionate desire for god. Drawing on earlier painting styles of western India, the Malwa artist reduced the narrative to its essentials, presenting only the brightly lit protagonists against an intense red ground, banded by a darkened skyline.",
