    "description": "The relationship of mother and son in daily life is a recurrent Harunobu theme, shown here in a scene of intimacy and tenderness. This is a rare example of a print bearing the seal of an American collector, Hamilton Easter Field (1873\u20131922). The seal, placed between the fan and the artist's signature at the lower right, consists of a stylization of his initials. The H at the center is flanked by an E on the left and an F on the right, which form the continuous outline of the stamp. Field, a collector, artist, and critic from Brooklyn, New York, adopted the Western tradition of stamping a specially designed seal on his Japanese ukiyo-e prints.",
