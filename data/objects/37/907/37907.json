    "description": "The conventions of this ragini vary, but the usual theme is a lady waiting for her lover. Here, she stands at the door, possibly looking out for him. This analysis is buttressed by the empty bed and the actions of her handmaidens, who attempt to cool and placate her. Hindu court poets invented extensive typologies of women and their lovers. These types appear in music, dance, devotional poetry, and secular literature as well as in painting.",
