    "description": "Early Indian paintings are often divided into multiple registers in which successive episodes of a story are related. Above, Krishna holds his hand in a gesture of exposition while Radha gazes on in erotic expectation. Below, an open garlanded bower anticipates their tryst and alludes to the sexual tension generated by Krishna\u2019s seduction of Radha, described in the associated passage of the Gita Govinda. This work, while based on earlier paintings by the artist Sahibdin, was probably produced in Manohar\u2019s workshop. It is characterized by a bolder but perhaps less refined style.",
