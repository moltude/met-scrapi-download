    "description": "Thamyris and the MusesVases associated with the Meidias Painter are often exceptionally interesting iconographically and very poorly preserved. Thamyris was a mythological musician who boasted that he could sing more beautifully than the Muses. He was blinded for his arrogance. While some representations reflect his fate, this hydria is among those that do not. Thamyris appears in an outdoor setting among music-making women and Erotes. Particularly noteworthy is a small platform beneath his feet with three figures of diminishing size. They are identified as representations of the Muses, making the location of the scene a sanctuary devoted to them.",
