    "description": "Legs and base are later additions to this false-grained case, which resembles a small harp laid sideways. Mozart supposedly carried a piano like this for practicing on journeys.  The narrow, 54-note keyboard is covered with fruitwood and bone; embossed paper ornaments the naturals' fronts. A simple action propels the hammers against damperless single strings. Knobs over the keyboard lower a mute near the bridge and interpose leather tabs between hammers and strings to modify the tone. Pianos of this form, peculiar to the Schmahl family, are each of slightly different design, indicating they were made one at a time, not in batches.  These utilitarian instruments typify provincial workmanship in southern Germany, outside the mainstream of development.",
