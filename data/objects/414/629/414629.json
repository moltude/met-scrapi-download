    "description": "Floor plans, aerial view and frontal view of the arcade in front of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. The aerial view shows that it concerns an earlier, not executed, stage of the plans in which the square would almost have been closed off completely by a third part of the arcade on the far side of the square. The scale of the images has been indicated below. Explanation of the different designs and measurements are given on the left and right. In the middle, on two banners held up by angels, the reason for the erection of the arcade is explain in Latin and Italian.",
