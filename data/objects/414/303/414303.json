    "description": "Although this is a very small print, it has been very finely cut by the artist No\u00ebl Rouillard. He was the son of a goldsmith, but it is unclear whether he ever actually worked as a goldsmith himself. He did however publish several print series with designs related to this profession. This print comes from a series of twelve such prints and shows a design for a lunar-shaped ring bezel in its center. Rouillard combined this design with several other motifs such as the fantastical creatures depicted on all four sides of the central motif.",
