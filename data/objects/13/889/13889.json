    "description": "The pieced Stars of Bethlehem appear in three blocks of different sizes. The mid-sized blocks are made into a border. The large central star is surrounded by four smaller stars at the corners. The entire piece is quilted in parallel lines following the outlines of the stars. All of the stars have red centers and concentric rings of diamond-shaped pieces in beige, brown, and light blue printed cottons. The sashing is of a brown printed cotton with colors that are complementary to the colors in the stars. The backing is of plain white woven cotton, and the edge binding is made from the Bashing fabric.",
