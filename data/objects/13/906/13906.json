In the pieced blocks, the quilting stitches follow the star shapes with parallel lines. In the plain white blocks, the quilting pattern alternates between four tulips and four leaves. The quilt has a cotton-batting filling, and the back is of plain white woven cotton. There are partial English design registration marks on some pieces of fabric.",
