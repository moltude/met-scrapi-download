    "description": "In 1916 Orrefors Glasbruk (Orrefors Glassworks) hired Simon Gate as its principal designer. Trained as a painter and an illustrator, Gate had no previous experience as a designer of three-dimensional objects. Unhampered by tradition or convention, he became one of the most innovative and influential figures in the early development of twentieth-century art glass. This remarkable footed bowl typifies his slottsglas, or \"castle glass,\" series-elegant pieces characterized by subtle delicacy in both form and color. The sinuous fluting of the bowl and foot creates pleasing gradations in the translucency of the gray-green glass. At the same time, the piece dramatically explores the technical limits of glassblowing: the extreme fragility of the thin walls and attenuated stem enhances the illusion that such glass was designed to be used in the appropriately refined environment of a castle or its domestic equivalent.",
