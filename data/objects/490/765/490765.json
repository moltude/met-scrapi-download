    "description": "This work is in part a tribute to Hamilton\u2019s friend and mentor Marcel Ducham (1887\u20131968), who helped him make a replica of his famous work The Bride Striped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) of 1915\u201323 (Philadelphia Museumof Art). To achieve the dreamlike imagery, Hamilton photographed an artist friend reading a letter in the hallway of his home and, using the computer, ghosted her semitransparent image into a glazed drawing in his hallway. He then scanned the\u201cBachelor Apparatus,\u201d which is a portion of Duchamp\u2019s The Large Glass, onto the glass, casting the woman as a gentle apparition in the midst of Duchamp\u2019s painting. The enigmatic title is also borrowed from a work by Duchamp.",
