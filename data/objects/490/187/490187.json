When I arrived, Pollock, de Kooning, Rothko, and all were already being recognized.\u201d He had studied with Amed\u00e9e Ozenfant, but preferred Hans Hofmann: \u201cHofmann got me freed up.\u201d The critic Clement Greenberg championed Goodnough for a while and wrote about this painting. \u201cHis small blackish painting in the . . . Newman collection is one of the best things in it, and that\u2019s saying a lot. The picture is tight, nuanced, and at the same time \u2018violent\u2019.\u201d",
