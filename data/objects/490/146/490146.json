Its unconventional decor reflected Misia's taste, which was inspired by the English Arts and Crafts movement. The apartment often served as an alternative office for Thad\u00e9e's lively avant-garde journal, \"La Revue blanche.\" Among the contributors to this influential publication were Claude Debussy, L\u00e9on Blum, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, and Andr\u00e9 Gide. The evocative Symbolist qualities of Mallarm\u00e9's poetry and Debussy's music find echoes in Vuillard's five panels, which take their name from this painting.",
