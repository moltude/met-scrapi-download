    "description": "In 1980\u201381 Hamilton took Polaroid photographs of himself through a pane of glass on which he had applied strokes of oil paint. He manipulated the lights, looked directly into the lens, and carefully positioned himself with regard to thebrushstrokes. He returned to the project several times, scanning, enlarging, and retouching the portraits using Quantel Paintbox. This large version is one of two made through pigment transfer in 1998. \u201cComputer-generated images,\u201d explains Hamilton, \u201clack the smell of turpentine and the touch of a bristle brush\u2014they can look clinical, artificial, or gaudy. The many variations on these self-portraits all attempt to get some paint back into the process.\u201d",
