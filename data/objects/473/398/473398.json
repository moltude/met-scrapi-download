At Epiphanius a large number of ostraca were discovered in the monastery, including in its rubbish heaps; they record biblical verses, legal documents, sermons, financial accounts, school texts, and letters requesting assistance and prayers. Some reveal that, even at the southernmost border of the Empire, people were still aware of events in the capital, Constantinople.Ostracon with a Letter from Joseph to\u2014This sinner beyond all the world it is writeth unto his beloved lords and pious, (saying,) Be so kind and pray for me, that the Lord stablish me: for I am a friendless man, but for God; I have none other except your charity. (Pray) that God would do a kindness unto me, [for] I am in great need. I desire indeed to labor a little, that the Lord may look upon my labor and may do a kindness unto me. For He giveth unto each according to his labor that he doeth. Be so good, forgive me that I have been a little disobedient. Be not wroth with me. Pray for my disobedience. God knoweth all things: (He knoweth) that I desire to obey (and) I desire to labor a little. Be so good and pray for me. Send me two asses that I may get fodder with them. Here is the book.
