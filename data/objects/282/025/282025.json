    "description": "Although neither Henning nor Ritchie was present at the historic signing of the Deed of Demission, Hill wanted to include his sculptor friends in his painting of the event.  Like many other calotypes made early in the Hill and Adamson partnership, this one served as a model for the finished painting: Henning and Ritchie can be seen in just these poses in the skylight of Tanfield Hall, at the upper left corner of Hill's painting.",
