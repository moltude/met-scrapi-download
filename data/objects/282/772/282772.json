    "description": "Orozco works in sculpture and photography in a style that is elegant, minimal, and anti-monumental. His sculptures are often ephemeral and his photographs of them give the constructed situations a longer life. In both, Orozco's odd interventions encourage an awareness of the poetic richness latent in ordinary things as well as of the temporal fragility of our accomplishments.",
