    "description": "Beginning in the late 1850s, Laurent worked for the Spanish photographic agency Ger\u00f3nimo. During thirty-five years of operation in Madrid, the firm produced some 20,000 photographs-a vast archive of Spanish art, architecture, and industrial achievement.This photograph, originally part of an album that documented the Zaragoza-Pamplona-Barcelona railway line, depicts a bridge spanning the dry bed of the G\u00e1llego River at Zuera, a desolate locale situated north of Zaragoza. Tight framing and dramatic foreshortening result in an image as geometrically conceived as the impressive technology that is represented. A tiny human presence, positioned at the far end of the bridge, emphasizes the imposing span and scale of this modern engineering feat.",
