    "description": "As a teenager in the 1960s, Shore was one of two in-house photographers at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory. During his first cross-country photographic road trip, Shore adopted the catholic approach of his mentor, accepting into his art everything that came along\u2014what he ate, the rest stops he visited, the people he met. He then processed his color film as \u201cdrugstore prints\u201d, the imprecise, colloquial term for the kind of amateur non-specialized snapshots that filled family photo albums. The entire series of 229 prints was shown for the first time in 1974 and acquired by the Metropolitan from that exhibition.",
