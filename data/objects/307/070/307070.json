    "description": "DeCarava emerged in the 1950s as one of the most important visual artists in the African American community. His groundbreaking book \"The Sweet Flypaper of Life\" (1955), with text by Langston Hughes, is a poignant study of street life in Harlem. Like James Agee and Walker Evans\u2019s \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\" (1941), it is a landmark collaboration between a writer and a photographer. Hughes\u2019s text\u2014a rambling story about a Harlem grandmother and her children and grandchildren\u2014flows around, and comments on, DeCarava\u2019s photographs. In this scene, made from an apartment window, an elegantly dressed woman strides down the sidewalk and gazes across a cobblestone street; Hughes\u2019s text reads, \u201cWell, where she lives they got an elevator. Pretty streets, clean, it\u2019s on the hill.\u201d",
