    "description": "ErosAstragals were popular toys in antiquity. As each side of an astragal is distinctive, what mattered in a game was how the pieces fell. Such games of chance also acquired prophetic or erotic aspects. The poet Anacreon wrote about the astragals of Eros\u2014the dice of Love. It is entirely appropriate that this large example is decorated with a lyre-playing Eros.",
