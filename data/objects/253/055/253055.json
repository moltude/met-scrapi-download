    "description": "Said to be from the Greek islandsIn the early third century A.D., some marble busts became so deep as to be almost half-statues and often included the arms, giving the image a lively appearance. This young woman has a hair arrangement made popular by Julia Domna, wife of the emperor Septimius Severus (r. A.D. 193\u2013211) and mother of the emperor Caracalla (r. A.D. 211\u2013217). Parted at the center, long locks framed the face, covering the ears and falling almost to the shoulders before looping back to form an enormous bun at the back of the head.",
