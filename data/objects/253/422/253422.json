    "description": "The funerary purpose of this krater is indicated by the prothesis scene\u2014the laying out of the deceased\u2014in the central metope on each side of the vase. Of particular interest are the images of battles on and around the two ships. The center of one ship is occupied by a figure seated under an awning as two warriors fight with swords near the stern. The central portion of the other ship is missing. The archer on the prow of this vessel, the warrior just above the prow, the proximity of the foot soldiers as well as the birds perched on the sterns of both ships suggest that the vessels are beached or at least close enough to be boarded from the shore. The person of rank under the awning, the variety of combatants, and the number of foot soldiers\u2014even if they are repeated for decorative purposes\u2014indicate that a specific event is depicted.",
