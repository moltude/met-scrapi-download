Two (Temperance and Justice) are in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, Paris, and one (Faith) is in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon.  They are related to the Cardinal Virtues by Luca della Robbia on the ceiling of the Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal in San Miniato, Florence, but they show the style of Luca's nephew, Andrea, who was the dominant force in the family business after ca. 1470.",
