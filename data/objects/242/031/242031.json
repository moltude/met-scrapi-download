    "description": "This figure exemplifies a well-established type that appears in Cypriot sculpture at the end of the seventh century B.C. The men are always under lifesize, beardless, and dressed in a close-fitting tunic, brief loincloth often decorated with rosettes, and headband with rosettes. The example here also wears earrings and bracelets. The identity of these figures is difficult to define precisely, but they are probably young men of high rank in some form of service to a deity. In this piece, the head may not belong to the body, but it is typologically accurate.",
