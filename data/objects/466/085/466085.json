According to legend, when Veronica wiped Jesus\u2019 face as he was led to Calvary, his image was miraculously imprinted on the cloth, which was eventually taken to Saint Peter\u2019s in Rome. Such images were intended to inspire meditation through visual identification with Christ\u2019s likeness.",
