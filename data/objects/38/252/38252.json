    "description": "It is unusual to find a peaceful Durga with four arms. Usually the multi-armed form of the Great Goddess is shown in an active pose as Mahishasuramardini, the slayer of Mahisha, the buffalo demon. Here she is richly adorned, wearing a tiara composed of three rounded panels and the three-pointed cape often depicted on dieties in Kashmir. She holds a sword in her lower right hand and a bell with ribbons in her lower left. Her upper left hand holds what appears to be a ram\u2019s head. The two male attendants each hold a manuscript, an object not usually associated with Durga.",
