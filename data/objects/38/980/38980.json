    "description": "The bodhisattva\u2019s broad, muscular torso, which originates in the Gandharan sculptural tradition, is combined with a refined treatment of the face and drapery that shows clear connections with the northern Indian Gupta tradition. This image is exceptional in terms of the preservation of its surface; note the detailed hair and jewelry and the striking use of inlaid silver for the eyes and urna (dot on his forehead). While the flask in his left hand identifies this figure as Maitreya, he holds up his right hand with the back turned toward us in a gesture that is occasionally displayed by attendant Maitreya figures in late Gandharan triads.",
