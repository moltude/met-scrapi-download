    "description": "This distinguished example of the pre-Angkor style comes from the Zhenla kingdom in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam. It preserves the flavor of Indian sculpture, particularly in the full, round forms of the face. Vishnu's headdress is the orthodox high miter. He holds a conch (shankha) in his raised left hand and a war discus (chakra) in his right. His lowered left hand rests on the remains of a mace (gada). Originally, there were structural supports between the sides of the miter and the upper emblems. A portion of one is still visible on the right side of the miter.",
