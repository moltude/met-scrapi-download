    "description": "In this extremely large sculpture, the Hindu god Vishnu is attended by his two consorts: to his left, Sarasvati, the goddess of poetry and music; to his right, Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune. The architectural ensemble in which they stand is inhabited by a series of gods, demigods, ascetics, and worshipers. Two river goddesses stand at the base of the columns. Beyond them, at the outer edges in niches, are figures representing the weapons of Vishnu in human form: Gadadevi (his mace) and Chakrapurusha (his war discus). Ganesha occupies the niche at the top left corner; Karttikeya occupies the corresponding spot on the right. The two inner niches house Shiva (left) and Brahma (right).",
