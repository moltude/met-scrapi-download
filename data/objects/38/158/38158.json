    "description": "Shiva can be identified by the vertical third eye on his forehead and by his hairstyle of individual locks piled high in a chignon. He wears only a wraparound skirt (sampot) secured by a sash. The statue is a classic example of the pre-Angkor Prasat Andet style, especially the low-relief treatment of the garments and the subtle articulation of the musculature. It is purported to have been found in Cambodia, near the Vietnamese border.",
