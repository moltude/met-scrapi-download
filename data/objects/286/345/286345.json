    "description": "Although not so recognized today, Fitz was a highly lauded advertising photographer in the 1920s and 1930s whose clients included many of the era\u2019s largest American businesses\u2014from Chevrolet Motor Company and AT&T to Ivory Soap and Ipana Toothpaste. Before launching his professional career in 1920, Fitz worked as an amateur pictorialist, submitting his highly aesthetic compositions to international competitions. This contemplative study of light patterns cast on the sand through the planks of a New York City boardwalk was shown in photographic salons in 1917 and 1918 and won awards in London, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles.",
