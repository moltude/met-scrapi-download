    "description": "The Russian avant-garde theater director Vsevolod E. Meyerhold believed it essential to have a photographic record of his productions, which otherwise were ephemeral. Fernand Crommelynk's Magnanimous Cuckold, staged in 1922, was the first to be so documented. Toltchan, a photographer and cameraman, portrayed the legendary director in action when the two worked together in Moscow in the 1920s.",
