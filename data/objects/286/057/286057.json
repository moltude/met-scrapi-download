    "description": "Born in Paris of Romanian parents, Lotar was a Surrealist filmmaker and photographer in the circle of Ren\u00e9 Clair, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Germaine Krull, and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz. In 1929 he accepted a commission from the review Documents, the voice of a Surrealist splinter group headed by Georges Bataille, to illustrate the word abattoir (\u201cslaughterhouse\u201d) in the \u201cDictionary\u201d section of the journal. In response, Lotar produced a photographic reportage of unsparing realism. His images are particularly shocking for their juxtapositions of killing on the one hand and banal order on the other. This subject is an array of amputated calves\u2019 feet.",
