    "description": "Since 1760, writers and artists of all disciplines and nationalities have met to converse and drink espresso at the famous Caff\u00e9 Greco in Rome. In 1848 Caneva moved from Bergamo to Rome and joined a group of like-minded painters at the caf\u00e9 interested in the new medium of photography. Thus began the informal first school of photography in Italy. This highly retouched view shows Vesuvius, the volcano responsible for burying the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79.",
