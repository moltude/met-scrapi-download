    "description": "Originally based in Harlem and co-owned by the famous dancer Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, the New York Black Yankees evolved from the very successful New York Lincoln Giants in 1932.  Unfortunately, the Black Yankees had a less impressive record, despite the efforts of gifted players such as Satchel Paige and George \"Mule\" Suttles.  The team played at Yankee Stadium while the Yankees were on the road and joined the Negro National League in 1936.  When Jackie Robinson broke major league baseball's color barrier in 1947, the Negro Leagues were mined for talent, causing many teams to disband, including the New York Black Yankees in 1950.",
