Often traveling incognito as an insurance inspector, Hine spent sixteen years visiting factories, mines, canneries, tenements, and sweatshops to document the plight of working children as young as four years old.  Small contact prints like this one were distributed to the press; Hine\u2019s images were also made into glass slides for projection during public lectures, and reproduced in NCLC publications.",
