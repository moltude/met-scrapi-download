    "description": "A painter in his own right, Condivi is perhaps best known as Michelangelo's biographer. Writing in part as a response to Vasari's 1550 account of the artist's life, Condivi had the benefit of working closely with Michelangelo on his manuscript. Although it is generally accepted that Condivi (and his subject) took liberties with Michelangelo's lineage, the chronology and details of the artist's working life are still held to be reliable. Condivi's work served as the basis for Vasari's revisions in his 1568 edition of \"Le vite de' pie eccelenti pittori, scultori e architetton.\"Illustrated: title page",
