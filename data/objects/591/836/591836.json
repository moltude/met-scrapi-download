    "description": "Domenico Martinelli's \"Ritratto di Venezia\" was created in 1684 as a tour book for visitors to Venice. A tremendous amount of detailed information has been packed into this compact, almost pocket-sized volume. As the title states, the work is divided into two sections. Part 1 describes most of the paintings, sculptures, epitaphs, and inscriptions found inside each church in Venice, providing today's reader with a rare picture of the city in the late seventeenth century. Of particular value are the works cited by Martinelli that are no longer in their original location. Part 2 briefly discusses the civic life of the Venetian Republic as well as some of the more notable public buildings and artworks contained therein.Illustrated: frontispiece",
