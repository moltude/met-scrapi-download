    "description": "Photojournalism has provided an important lens for social reflection in struggles for equality around the world. Traveling with Martin Luther King Jr. to the March on Washington, Freed made some of the most iconic images of the Civil Rights era but was also drawn to moments of quiet camaraderie. The images in his book Black in White America (1968) register his skill in capturing fleeting yet suggestive expressions and gestures. Freed\u2019s photograph of a small group of Nation of Islam members\u2014individuals as carefully composed as his portrait\u2014embodies the compassion with which his imagery pressed Americans to face the country\u2019s legacy of injustice.",
