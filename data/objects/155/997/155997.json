    "description": "Donated to the Brooklyn Museum collection by the designer's wife, actress Janet Gaynor (1906-1984), this dress provides an example of Adrian's recurring use of animal prints and patterns in his designs. Here a snakeskin pattern appears on a lam\u00e9 fabric and elevates a basic suit silhouette into a dramatic ensemble that recalls some of the designer's well-known Hollywood costumes. Adrian made several versions of this suit, of which one appeared in American Vogue in [date].",
