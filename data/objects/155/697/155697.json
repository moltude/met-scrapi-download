    "description": "Yves Saint Laurent's Rive Gauche line for women debuted in 1966, with menswear following in 1969. In promoting ready-to-wear clothing, Saint Laurent successfully outfitted a new group of consumers with his designs. In this example, Saint Laurent showed how a functional garment, a basic man's raincoat, could be adapted, enlivened and made fashionable. Men's clothing in the 1960s incorporated colors far beyond the traditional muted palette and the teal blue of this raincoat illustrates how the \"peacock revolution\" of that decade extended into the 1970s.",
