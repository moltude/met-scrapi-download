    "description": "The French lingerie industry, like the couture industry, excelled at employing inventive and creative techniques, both decorative and technical. In this example, the mythical griffin is incorporated in the drawnwork decoration. Griffins, a creature with characteristics of both the lion and eagle, were the guardians of treasure and the divine in legend. Designers were faced with a constant demand for novelty and sophistication that their wealthy clients expected, even in their underpinnings. The original owner of this lingerie set, Millicent Rogers, is known for her particular penchant to choose the most interesting and often unusual clothing and accessories, which as seen here, includes her lingerie. The final customization, the personal monogram \"MM\" for Mary Millicent, her given name, surmounted by a crown is the ultimate touch of custom work.",
