    "description": "The Osgood collection comprises 179 objects, chiefly fashionable Italian-made women's shoes dating from the years 1954 to 1958.  The shoes were collected by Charline Osgood, Director of the Kid Leather Guild, a trade organization of American kid leather manufacturers.  Highlighting the use of kid leather in footwear, the collection provides a fascinating and enticing view of high-style European shoe design from the period, representing many of the finest and most inventive Italian makers.Subtle detailing at the heel distinguishes this design rendered in taupe Smooth Kid by Amalgamated Leather Companies, Inc. and white kid by G. Levor & Co.  The innovative feature appealing to Osgood was the sexy, naked look at the back which employs high-set crisscross straps.  The use of this configuration of straps in lieu of an ankle strap provides better security and a more up-to-date look.",
