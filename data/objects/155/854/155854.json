    "description": "Designed for Schiaparelli's summer 1940 collection, this jacket was worn with a black mermaid dress and a jet beaded black tulle hat (see 2009.300.1164). In sophisticated pink twill trimmed with contrasting black Spanish-influenced embroidery, the jacket exudes a certain chic that would be increased as worn by Millicent Rogers, the original owner. This design was well-received by the fashion press, particularly the mermaid dress, Schiaparelli's newest silhouette for evening. As war was spreading across Europe, Schiaparelli chose to focus on femininity and youth, and this jacket, as well as the ensemble as a whole, is the epitome of both.",
