    "description": "The finest lingerie that was made during the early 20th century was made in France. Unusual for 20th century lingerie, the lace on this set is hand rather than machine made. In further testament to  its high quality, the swag motif , which is worked in needlemade buds, follows the contours of the bust, suggesting that the lace was made specifically for this type of garment.",
