    "description": "The house of Dior launched a line of men's wear called \"Christian Dior Monsieur\" in 1970. While Christian Dior himself never designed garments for men, the creation of the line symbolized the viability of the company more than a decade after the death of its founder. This handsome ensemble dates from the early years of the Dior menswear line. A well-made example of a day suit, the details of its construction, such as the exaggerated length of the coat, the elongated peaked lapels and the flared pants, reflect the style of the moment. The buttons, upon close inspection, are found to be stylized \"CD\" initials, another detail of high-quality design.",
