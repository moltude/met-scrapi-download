    "description": "During the 1970s men broke out of their usual staid business attire and experimented with more stylish silhouettes, fabrics and forms. This ensemble is a combination of parts created by the donor and features bell-bottom pants, which typify that trend. The production of the garments is also noteworthy: the suit fabric was made in England but the suit was probably designed and constructed in Finland; the sweater was commissioned in Italy by an American company, unusual for that time.",
