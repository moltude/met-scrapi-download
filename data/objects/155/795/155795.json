    "description": "This evening dress is an excellent example, showing the transition from the 1920s to 1930s silhouette.  The shape of the dress remains tubular, with a low-waisted bodice, but the hemline has been lengthened with the addition of the tier.  Eventually, the waist would return to its natural place, accenting the figure.  The decoration is also of interest for the bezel set stones creating the overall design are not a typical form of decoration.",
