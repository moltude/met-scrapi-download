    "description": "Jacques Doucet was first, and foremost, a connoisseur of art.  Additionally, his passion for the refined and exquisite overflowed into his dealings with fashion, making him one of the finest French couturiers during the Belle \u00c9poque.  The House of Doucet began as a family business, specializing in women's lingerie and laces, as well as articles of clothing for men.  Founded in 1817, the company rose to fame under the hand of Jacques.  The house was known for its luxurious offerings, which were worn and coveted by royalty, members of the elite society in both Europe and America, and actresses of the stage.Possibly worn by one of New York's finest, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor Wilson, this afternoon dress is a perfect example of couture during this period.  The sheer pink fabric, accented with lace and black and pink ribbon trim, is a dress to be displayed at garden parties and the races.  Doucet added interest to his work with his use of unusual trims, illustrating his inventiveness and artistic taste.",
