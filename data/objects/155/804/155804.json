    "description": "This shirt was created, from the linen fiber to the finished garment, by the donor's great-grandmother, Elizabeth Wild Hitchings, for her husband Benjamin Hitchings, a sea captain, in 1816.  It was common practice for a wife or servant to hand stitch family members' shirts prior to the mid-19th century, but rarely was such handiwork recorded, making this case rare and intriguing.  In addition, its elegant stitching makes it a perfect example of the familial care taken in sewing prior to the common possession and use of the sewing machine.",
