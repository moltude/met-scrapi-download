    "description": "In connection with the inauguration of the galleries in the fall of 1905, Steichen created a poster showing a photographer silhouetted against a green field beneath a glimmering orb.  Although Steichen's design suggests that the photographer is a hunter who stalks his prey in a moonlit landscape, the actual model, a snapshot of Stieglitz hard at work on a city bridge with a Graflex camera, shows the telling difference between Stieglitz's more urgent urban vision and Steichen's more serene and sylvan poetics.",
