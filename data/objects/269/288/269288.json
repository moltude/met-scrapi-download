    "description": "The German composer and conductor Richard Strauss (1864-1949) visited the United States for the first time in the spring of 1904.  He came to New York expressly to conduct the premier of Symphonia domestica (1903), an orchestral work which caused a stir in the music community by detailing the composer\u2019s own life at home with his wife and child.  Known by such repertory standards as the operas Salome, Elektra, and Der Rosenkavalier, Strauss is shown here as the paradigmatic Romantic genius.",
