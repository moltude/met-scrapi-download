    "description": "Cameron long wished to photograph the brilliant but controversial historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle (1795\u20131881) and ultimately took her camera to London to do so. \u201cWhen I have had such men before my camera,\u201d she wrote, \u201cmy whole soul has endeavored to do its duty towards them in recording the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man. The photograph thus taken has been almost the embodiment of a prayer.\u201d Cameron inscribed Herschel\u2019s print of this powerful image: \u201cCarlyle like a rough block of Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture.\u201d Carlyle, on the other hand, wrote of it to Cameron: \u201cTerrifically ugly and woe-begone, but has something of likeness: my candid opinion.\u201d Before Cameron and her husband moved to Ceylon in 1875, she contracted with the Autotype Company in London to produce copy negatives of seventy of her most iconic images (many original negatives having deteriorated) and to publish positives from them for sale to the public in the more permanent process of carbon printing. This print, one such example, belonged to Alfred Stieglitz, who found Cameron\u2019s work to be in harmony with his own ideas about artistic photography. He published this image and others in his luxurious journal Camera Work in 1913.",
