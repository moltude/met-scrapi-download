    "description": "This sculpture is a reduction of the Victory that is part of the Sherman Monument (1903; New York, Grand Army Plaza).  The famed equestrian statue, dedicated to the Civil War hero William Tecumseh Sherman (1820\u20131891), is one of Manhattan's finest public sculptures, and a noble heir to the equestrian tradition begun in ancient Rome and continued through the Renaissance.  Saint-Gaudens' \"Victory\" has traditional attributes\u2014a laurel crown and a palm leaf\u2014and is depicted by Saint-Gaudens as a guiding force.  Her outstretched right arm leads the obediant horse, upon which sits a battle-hardened General Sherman. Saint-Gaudens painstakingly arranged drapery on numerous nude models for \"Victory\" before settling on what he believed was the perfect flow of her robe.  Letters written by Saint-Gaudens near the completion of the monument reveal his triumphant feelings about the monument, and the figure of \"Victory.\"  In a letter to his niece, Rose S. Nichols, he wrote, \"It's the greatest 'Victory' anybody ever made.  Hooraah!\"",
