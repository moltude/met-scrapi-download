    "description": "In southern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Dida female weavers have developed a distinctive tradition of fiber creations whose aesthetic features low-relief sculptural qualities and dynamic compositions. Through a labor-intensive creative process of successive stages, extremely fine linen-like fabrics are produced from raffia-palm fibers that are interlaced and tie-dyed. Apparel composed from these precious and costly fabrics were owned only by a privileged elite to be worn on important occasions. Square panels were created as part of an ensemble of prestigious ceremonial apparel. They were designed to be held in the hand to be brandished as an aesthetic flourish when dancing.",
