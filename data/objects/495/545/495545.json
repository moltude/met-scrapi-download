    "description": "Gazbia Sirry is one of the many accomplished women artists who have made a mark in the Egyptian arts throughout the twentieth century. She stood out for her dedication to the individual freedom of the Arab woman through her fighting spirit. Sirry's ardent enthusiasm for innovation and her openness to international influences made her a vital contributor to the Contemporary Art Group in Cairo. A prolific painter, she has experimented with a range of styles. Her early works resembled illustrations inspired by children's coloring books. But she soon shifted to an Expressionist style in which her use of heavy impasto, quickly applied and violently scratched, explored a thematic revolving around the artist herself or groups of individuals and couples. Her figures seem to be struggling to emerge from the whirlpool of life, or have gathered together for sheer survival in an urban environment gone astray.",
