    "description": "The very fine, regular hatching and delicate, soft modeling in this drawing differ from the style of Stefano da Verona. Endowing the figure with a classicizing and sculptural quality, the artist, an unknown Veronese draftsman of the mid-fifteenth century, was particularly concerned with the twisting folds of drapery around the figure. The lack of attributes and setting make it difficult to determine her identity or the intended context. The figure may represent a Virtue such as Hope, who is often portrayed with upraised arms, or a Sibyl.",
