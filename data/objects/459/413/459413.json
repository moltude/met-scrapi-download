    "description": "The Lombard artist Michelino da Besozzo was celebrated during his lifetime for his naturalism, especially in rendering animals and birds. This magnificent drawing, probably made by an artist strongly influenced by Michelino, resembles the technique of the illuminations for which he was famous. As it is executed on vellum (a fine-quality parchment) rather than paper, it may have come from a model book; such books were commonly used at the time to record motifs for later use in painted compositions.",
