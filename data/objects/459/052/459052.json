    "description": "A celebrated masterpiece of Northern Renaissance Art, this painting attests to Netherlandish artists\u2019 keen interest in pictorial illusionism and meticulous attention to detail. Petrus Christus, the leading painter in Bruges (Flanders) after the death of Jan van Eyck, signed and dated the work in 1449. The luminous jeweled, glass, and metallic objects -- secular and ecclesiastic trade wares -- likely served as an advertisement for the goldsmith\u2019s guild of Bruges, who may have commissioned the painting. The main figure in this enigmatic painting, traditionally identified as Saint Eligius (the patron saint of goldsmiths), is more likely a portrait of an actual goldsmith of fifteenth-century Bruges. The sumptuously dressed couple is buying a wedding ring that is being weighed on a scale, while the girdle that extends over the ledge of the shop into the viewer\u2019s space is a further allusion to matrimony. The convex mirror, which links the pictorial space to the street outside, reflects two young men with a falcon (symbol of pride and greed) and establishes a moral comparison between the imperfect world of the viewer and the world of virtue and balance depicted here.",
