    "description": "By the end of the fourteenth century, the cassone, or chest, was the most sumptuous piece of furniture in the Italian household.(1)  Between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, a woman\u2019s right to inherit property and resources from her parents and her  husband diminished as society became more patriarchal. Accordingly, the dowry \u2014 the financial allotment given to a woman by her family upon her marriage (or upon entering a nunnery) \u2014 increased in importance. Although the dowry belonged to the woman, it was administered by her husband, who assumed responsibility to increase its value. Often the chest was provided by the future husband and sent to the bride\u2019s parents\u2019 house to be filled with the marriage portion. Later it was carried back to the groom\u2019s home in a public, ceremonial procession (see Fig. 123.1).(2)  Usually made as pairs or even as two ensembles, such richly ornamented chests were displayed together as a testimony to the wealth of the two families and the bond newly forged between them, as their ostentatious decoration reflected the valuables stored within. The practice of moving valuable furniture from residence to residence has restricted the rate of survival of such cassoni. The method of the surface decoration was therefore an important choice. Resplendent pieces with gilded ornaments were particularly vulnerable to damage. The technique often applied to the surface of this type is called pastiglia. Yorke pointed out that \u201cgesso and pastiglia are two different things in contemporary accounts. Cassone decoration, described in books from the late 19th century onwards as pastiglia, is in fact gilt gesso.\u201d(3)  Pastiglia was used mostly for small caskets and boxes and has proven far too fragile to be applied to large areas.(4)  The present chest is part of a small group of extant, similarly elaborate cassoni dating from about the second quarter of the fifteenth century. It is one of the most esteemed furniture objects within the Robert Lehman Collection and as such, of the holdings of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The simple but striking appearance of the Lehman chest shows affinities with the front decoration of a sarcophagus that Andrea Pisano depicted in his bronze relief Burial of Saint John the Baptist of 1330 \u2013 36 on the South Doors of the Baptistery of San Giovanni, Florence.(5)  However, although the type is mainly associated with Florence and Siena, the complete gilding of a chest\u2019s surface was a practice used throughout the Italian peninsula. As Yorke explains, a sufficient amount was being produced in Venice \u201cfor a sumptuary law to be passed in 1489 to control expenditure on luxury goods by banning the making or use of chasse dorate (gilt chests).\u201d(6)  Related versions are in the Museo Stefano Bardini, Florence,(7) the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo, Rome, the Grassi Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst, Leipzig,(8) the Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst, Cologne,(9) the Victoria and Albert Museum, London,(10) the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston,(11) the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond,(12) and the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.(13)  As the ends are considerably restored and repainted with fleurs-de-lis, possibly to enhance the object\u2019s prestige and value, it seems difficult to establish any connection with Florence itself until the layers of paint of the arms are scientifically analyzed. The fleur-de-lis of Florence, which was essentially the Florentine Iris (Iris florentina), the emblem of the town, later became associated with the form of a stylized lily.(14)  Indeed, this important group of cassoni merits its own study.
