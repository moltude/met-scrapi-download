        "The three panels belonged until 1819 to Fauris de Saint Vincens, Aix-en-Provence.  After his death two, and possibly all three, panels were acquired for the Mus\u00e9e de la Ville d'Aix.  Only two are catalogued there in 1851, and the present panel appeared in 1853 at the sale of the estate of M. Cl\u00e9rian, director of the \u00c9cole de Dessin at Aix (sale, Simonet, Paris, March 14-16, 1853, no. 28, as Giotto).  It passed to the collection of the painter Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me (d. 1904) in Paris.  Purchased by Philip Lehman from Gimpel and Wildenstein, Paris, in February 1916."
