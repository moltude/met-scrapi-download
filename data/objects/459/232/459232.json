    "description": "Famous even in his lifetime, Martin Schongauer shaped and revitalized German art, integrating it with the achievements of the great Netherlandish masters. While he elevated the engraving technique to a pinnacle of perfection--surpassed only by Albrecht D\u00fcrer--Schongauer was also a gifted panel painter and draftsman. The exceedingly rare \"Man in a Hat Gazing Upward\" is one of few drawings whose attribution to Schongauer is universally embraced. His versatile pen lines of parallel and cross-hatched strokes, dots, and curliques delineate texture and form. The stubble of the aging face, for example, contrasts with the soft collar of fur, in turn offset by the parallel arcs of the hat brim. The physiognomy appears to be that of a character head rather than a portrait; the modeling of the facial features links the drawing to Schongauer's later engravings.",
