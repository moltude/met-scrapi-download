    "description": "This farmyard group consists of a cart, a plough, two bulls, two oxen, two sheep, two goats, and two pigs. All fourteen pieces are said to have been found together and probably comprised a votive offering or a child's toy. The plough was cast in one piece of bronze, but the joints of the wooden original model are still all indicated. The wheels of the cart are of a type used by the Etruscans. The shape of the cart has parallels in Roman iconography. For example, it is similiar in style to carts used for the transportation of food or baggage on the Column of Trajan in Rome from the second century A.D.",
