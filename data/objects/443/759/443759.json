    "description": "This lavishly decorated sleeve fragment demonstrates many of the characteristics of textiles dating from the end of Byzantine rule in Egypt and the years following the Arab conquest: bright colors, heavy outlines, and abstracted natural elements. Brightly colored roundels, flowers, and small florets are symmetrically arranged in a diamond grid of jewel-like leaflets; a border of linked chevrons completes the design. The sleeve is finished with a dark weft-pattern band decorated with rosettes.",
