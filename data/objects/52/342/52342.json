    "description": "The lotus is a Buddhist symbol of purity and perfection because it grows out of mud but is not defiled. The pattern of lotus petals on water is found at least as early as the late Heian period and is seen, for example, in the illustrated sutras given by the Heike family to Itsukushima Shrine in 1164. This kesa's corner and central patches are no longer attached, allowing a rare glimpse of the vestment's original bright coloration.",
