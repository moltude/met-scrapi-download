    "description": "This elegant silver cross has flared arms ending in serifs. Similar crosses were given to churches and shrines as votive gifts.Crosses were everywhere in the early Byzantine world. They marked religious, secular, and domestic buildings, public works, clothes and jewelry, and objects in the home. The cross was a sign of Christ's triumph over death and the hope of eternal life and was frequently ascribed apotropaic, or protective, powers by the faithful.",
