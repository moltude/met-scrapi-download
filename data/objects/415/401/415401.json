    "description": "Page with two designs for a commode. The upper half of the page shows a design for a commode in Louis XIV style. It has two doors, each with four panels of which the grains form a lozenge. The color of these panels differs from the surrouding wood. There are two brass female terminal figures on the corners of the commode which support the marble slab on top. The second,  Louis XV style commode is meant for a salon. It is characterized by flowing concave and convex lines with a protruding part in the middle. This part is accentuated by a cartouche formed by the bronze ornaments in which a colored floral motif is placed. The top of the commode is covered by a slab of marble with a purple hue.",
