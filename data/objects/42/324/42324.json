    "description": "The Yixing kilns in Jiangsu Province, which flourished in the late Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing dynasties, are best known for their unglazed vessels made from dark clays. Unlike porcelains produced elsewhere, works from Yixing were often signed, and they were made by both professional and amateur potters. This vase, whose shape is based on Bronze Age prototypes, is decorated with angular spirals and a masklike motif, known as a taotie, that was ubiquitous in early China.",
