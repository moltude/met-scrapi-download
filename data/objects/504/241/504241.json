    "description": "Based on Zumpe's simple design, this elegant square incorporates several English innovations: additional keys extend under the soundboard, along an enlarged compass of 5-1/2 octaves; counterweighted brass damper levers pivot beneath the strings; tuning pins have been moved from the right side, where they were crowded and far from the lowest key, to a convenient arrangement along the back. This piano has no damper control; the pedal opens the lid flap over the soundboard when the main lid panel is closed. Broadwood replaced hand stops by pedals around 1785. By the 1790s his firm was making about 400 squares and 100 grands annually.",
