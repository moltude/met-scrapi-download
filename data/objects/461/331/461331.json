    "description": "The Robert Lehman Collection holds two representatives of a rare and important chair type that relates closely to two objects in the Department of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum.(1)  The group of four provides an  opportunity to study this specific type of southern European furniture.(2)  The conspicuous decoration and imposing, thronelike appearance identify such seating as accoutrements of powerful owners from the late fifteenth century well into the seventeenth century, during which time the type never fell out of fashion. The chairs\u2019 shape and the materials embellishing them influenced \u00e9b\u00e9nistes around the Mediterranean, including, in the nineteenth century, Syria and Egypt.(3)  This furniture was generally classified as originating from \u201cUpper Italy\u201d and dated to the sixteenth or seventeenth century.(4)  The design of the precious tarsia a toppo marquetry on the chairs\u2019 frames consists of tiny polygonal pieces of differently colored woods, bone, and metal arranged in geometric patterns. Some of the configurations on the present chair can be fully appreciated only with the aid of a magnifying instrument. The pattern may have evolved from the medieval creations of colored stone and glass mosaics collectively given the name \u201cCosmati work,\u201d after the family with the greatest known production. The Lehman chair reveals a Moorish influence in the inverted Gothic \u201cpinnacle pendants\u201d on the front legs that form crescents resembling ogee arches. These recall the arcades surrounding the Court of the Lions (begun before 1391) in the Alhambra at Granada and others on the Moorish-Renaissance facade of the Palacio de Jabalquinto in Baeza of the 1490s.(5)  The Spanish terms for this descendant of the ancient Roman curule chair are sill\u00f3n de cadera (hip-joint chair) and jamuga (a woman\u2019s saddle, that is sidesaddle). As the type spread throughout Europe and parts of Spanish America it acquired many other names: during the Renaissance Revival it was described as \u201cDantesque\u201d or \u201cDantesca\u201d(after Dante Alighieri, 1265 \u2013 1321).(6)  The key piece indicating a Hispano-Moresque attribution and a date in the late fifteenth century for the present chair is a work formerly in the collection of Paul d\u2019Almeida of Madrid and Tegernsee (Germany). The d\u2019Almeida backrest retains its original leather cover, which is embossed with an inscription in Kufic calligraphy referring to the last Muslim ruler of Granada, Muhammad XI, called Boabdil by Spanish historians, who ascended the throne in 1482, and was forced to abdicate in 1492 after the battle of Lucena (he died in 1527).(7)  Symbolizing ecclesiastical as well as secular power, the type became an established seat of the higher clergy: a commission from the Toledo cathedral for three sill\u00f3nes de cadera is documented in Granada (one work is still part of the cathedral\u2019s treasury). In the flourishing market for luxury goods \u2014 for example, Hispano-Moresque ceramics were exported in quantities to Italy \u2014 similar seats not only were sold to other countries but also may have served as an inspiration for local craftsmen, who then created variations in Italy. The impressive list of surviving works, among them pieces in the Louvre, Paris, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., the Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional, Madrid, and a pair in the Lemmers-Danforth collection, Wetzlar, Germany, is astonishing.(8)  The style was popular, entering various princely collections throughout Europe and Britain and appearing as a symbol of power in a number of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century portraits, thereby documenting its dates. Among the most outstanding is a portrait by Gerlach Flicke (died 1558) of Thomas Cranmer (1489 \u2013 1556), archbishop of Canterbury, ten years before he was burned at the stake (National Portrait Gallery, London).(9)  One by Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta (1521 \u2013 1575) of the papal nuncio Girolamo Verallo, who was appointed a prince of the Church (1549; Galleria Spada, Rome),(10) and another by Alessandro Allori (1535 \u2013 1607), a portrait of Bianca Cappello de\u2019 Medici (1548 \u2013 1587) and her son, Antonio de\u2019 Medici (1576 \u2013 1621), show the subjects in these chairs (Fig. 159.1).(11)  Documentary evidence exists as well: five chairs of this type are described in the will of Sir John Gage of Firle Place in Sussex in 1556.(12)  It is difficult to determine whether the leather on the present chair is of Italian origin, as suggested by Thurman,(13) and not of Spanish manufacture, as workers in both areas used similar tools and techniques. The tarsia a toppo is slightly less complicated than in some of the works mentioned above; specifically, the inlay does not contain the configuration of the \u201cnine squares\u201d (see 1975.1.1979a,b).
