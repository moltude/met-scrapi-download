    "description": "During a 1913 trip to the small village of C\u00e9ret, Gris experimented with his personal style of Cubism, juxtaposing planes of various brightly colored patterns. On stylistic grounds, it is safe to assume that this work was painted during this three-month vacation in the Spanish Pyrenees; however, it bears no signature or date and is one of many still lifes executed by the artist.",
