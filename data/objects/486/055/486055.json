    "description": "Susan Rothenberg first came to prominence in the 1970s with large figurative paintings; in an art world then dominated by abstract, Minimalist aesthetics, these arresting images \u2013 notably her monumental horses \u2013 created a powerful impression. Rothenberg\u2019s more recent paintings are informed by her New Mexico ranch, where she has lived since the 1990s, and her observations of its parched landscape and \"small dramas,\" which become starting points for painterly experiments in color and perspective. Galisteo Creek was inspired by a walk along the creek that runs near her home. In this aerial view, the artist\u2019s dogs run across the white, bending creek as black ravens fly overhead, impervious to the rotting corpse of a calf lying to the right of the water.",
