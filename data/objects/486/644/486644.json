    "description": "The four prints in this series, which grew out of Hodgkin's unrealized plan to illustrate Thomas Mann's novel Death in Venice (1912), are based on an imaginary view of the city at different times of the day. Among the most complex prints the artist has produced, they were all printed from the same five printing plates. The first three in the series are richly colored and executed on sixteen separate sheets, while the last, Venice, Night, is a diptych in black and gray. Certain marks and formats are repeated throughout the series, but each image exudes its own distinct mood and emotional tenor. The Venice prints retain the exhilarating immediacy of the artist's paintings in the high drama of their surging, explosive forms.",
