Nevertheless, Zeus came to her as a shower of gold and Perseus was born.  The king had Dana\u00eb and Perseus put into a wooden chest and set adrift to die at sea.  After many adventures, including his beheading of Medusa the Gorgon, Perseus returned to Argos and fulfilled the prophecy.  Here in a quiet but tense moment, Dana\u00eb and the baby react with horror and pleading before the chest is closed.",
