    "description": "Translucent blue green, with same color handle and trail.Thick folded rim, flattened into broad flaring mouth; cylindrical neck expanding downwards; horizontal shoulder with overhanging rounded bulge below; cylindrical body with slightly concave vertical side; pushed-in bottom with central pontil scar; thick rod handle applied to shoulder, drawn out and up, then turned in, and trailed on to edge and underside of rim.On neck, single uneven trail wound round one and a half times horizontally. On body, close-set spiral ribs descending from left to right and narrow vertical ribs, creating a slanting notched pattern.Intact; blowing striations, pinprick and some larger bubbles, and black impurities in rim; slight dulling and pitting, with patches of weathering and iridescence on exterior, patches of encrustation, creamy brown weathering, and brilliant iridescence on interior.The patterning on the body is clearly intended to imitate basketry.",
