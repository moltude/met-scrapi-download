    "description": "Liebling was born in New York City and after serving in the Army in North Africa and Europe in World War II, he returned home and enrolled in art and design classes at Brooklyn College. While studying with the painter Ad Reinhardt, he picked up the camera and began his half-century career as a socially concerned photographer, filmmaker, and professor\u2014 first at the University of Minnesota (1949) and then at Hampshire College in Massachusetts (1969). This scene of bathers enjoying a summer day in the cool waters beneath the Brooklyn Bridge is among his first works in the medium and clearly shows the influence of Reinhardt, whose own compositions of that year are characterized by large tonal fields with small marks and gestures.",
