    "description": "Following France\u2019s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and the fall of Napoleon III, thousands of Parisians revolted against the new royalist-leaning government and declared Paris an independent commune. Weeks of fighting ensued, during which Versailles troops attacked the city while the Communards threw up barricades, shot hostages, and burned government buildings. Soon afterward, Appert, a Parisian portrait photographer, issued \u201cCrimes of the Commune,\u201d a tendentious series of nine photographs of the insurrection that emphasized the criminal brutality of the rebels. Although based on real events, the photographs were utterly fabricated. Appert hired actors to restage each scene in his studio then cut and pasted the figures onto the appropriate backgrounds; atop the actors\u2019 bodies he pasted headshots of the Commune\u2019s key participants. The photographs were later banned by the French government for \u201cdisturbing the public peace\u201d by sustaining anti-Communard sentiments\u2014a testament to their effectiveness as political propaganda.",
