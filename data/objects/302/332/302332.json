    "description": "Although the identities of both the maker and the sitters are unknown, the size and lavish presentation of this daguerreotype suggest that the girls were of high social status, and the quality of the daguerreotype indicates an accomplished portrait studio, probably in a major city. While far from a snapshot\u2014the possibility of which was still many decades away\u2014this portrait of two girls (sisters, one assumes) has an air of authenticity and spontaneity of expression and gesture that removes it from the typically stiff, expressionless portraits cranked out by less talented artisans.",
