    "description": "Working collaboratively since 1990, Anderson and Low are best known for their elegant portraits of athletes, military cadets, and circus performers. For their most recent project, Manga Dreams, they worked with teenagers and young adults on a series of portraits inspired by the extravagantly stylized figures of Japanese manga and anime. Together, the artists and models developed fictional identities based on archetypal characters\u2014warrior, princess, gangster, street punk\u2014and portrayed them by means of elaborate costumes, hairstyles, makeup, and digital image manipulation. The final photographs, as in this portrait of a young warrior crouching in a flat, cartoonish landscape, are exuberant cross-cultural hybrids of fantasy and reality.",
