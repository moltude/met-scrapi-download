Here, he wears a skirt of peacock feathers and is portrayed as a generic hero, not as Krishna. He balances on his raised left hand a golden vessel holding flowers, perhaps another metaphor for the season. The circular grouping created by the attendant female musicians consciously evokes Krishna\u2019s raslila dance with the gopis.",
