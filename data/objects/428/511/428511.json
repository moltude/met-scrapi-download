    "description": "Ogden Codman was one of the most successful American architects of the second half of the 18th century. He studied at MIT and had a small architectural firm in Boston between 1891 and 1893. One of his first important commissions was the interior decoration of Cornelius II Vanderbilt\u2019s (American, 1842-1899) Summer House, The Breakers, in Newport, Rhode Island. He decorated the rooms inspired by 18th-century French and Italian designs. In this wall elevation he specifically chose for the late Baroque period, with cabinets inspired by Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle (French, Paris 1642-1732 Paris) and a painting close to -ornament prints made by Daniel Marot (French, Paris 1661-1752 The Hague). A few years later he would work for Frederik William Vanderbilt (American, 1856-1938) on his monumental estate Hyde Park. The bedroom of Frederik\u2019s wife Louise (American, 1844-1926) was modeled after Marie-Antoinette\u2019s bedroom at Versailles. In keeping with old traditions, Codman constructed the balustrade in his drawing as a moveable part so that the ensemble could be viewed as a whole, while the details of the stately bed would not be lost. Codman worked on a large number of interiors in a wide array of styles for the nouveau riche on the East Coast before retiring to France in 1920.",
