    "description": "Design for a rock crystal chandelier, produced in Italy (Milan). According to the inscription, added both in German and Latin, the chandelier supports 36 candles and is 9 1/2 Rhinish feet high while its circumference measures 21 Rhinish feet. The chandelier hung in the house chapel of the Peller family in Nuremberg. It was originally commisioned in Italy (ca. 1694) as a gift for the princely house of Thurn and Taxis. The merchant family Peller acted as an intermediate in this commission and when no agreement was reached over the final price of the chandelier they kept it in their house. Eventually they sold it to the Prussian King who had it restored and hung in the 'Rittersaal' in Berlin.",
