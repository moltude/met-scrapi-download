    "description": "This beautifully complex design is made by the German artist Hans Jakob Ebelmann. Not much is known about this artist other than the print series he produced which show designs for furniture and architecture in the very exuberant style typical for the late Renaissance in Central Europe. Based on his designs and his collaboration with the cabinetmaker Jakob Guckeisen he is presumed to have been a cabinetmaker himself. The ceiling designs he published in a series in 1609 can be considered as his finest works. They show a highly inventive combination and use of ornaments and motifs and are etched in a spontaneous yet refined manner.",
