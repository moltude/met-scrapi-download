    "description": "A successful theatrical photographer in London, McBean crafted masterful portraits of actors in their signature roles as well as more fanciful fabrications, including the Christmas cards he sent to close friends. Nearly every card features the bearded, twinkly-eyed McBean as the star of a different whimsical scenario. Here, he and his partner, David Ball, encounter a colossal nude in a barren lunar landscape that owes much to the Surrealist geographies of Salvador Dal\u00ed and Giorgio di Chirico.",
