    "description": "Before his death from AIDS in 1987 at age fifty-three, Hujar was an influential figure in New York's downtown demimonde. (Nan Goldin once said she would never have become a photographer if it had not been for Hujar.) Hujar's photographic work is held together less by subject or style than by a particular sensibility: intimate and somber, carnal yet formally refined, cool yet oddly emotional, like a sad song with a good beat. Hujar spent many nights wandering the streets of downtown Manhattan with his camera, creating images that exude a sense of expectation and desire. This photograph is one of three that he made of men cruising in Stuyvesant Square Park, a few blocks from his loft on Second Avenue.",
