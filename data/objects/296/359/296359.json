    "description": "This photograph shows the 1860s restoration of Sainte Chapelle (now called Chapelle Saint-Louis) in the ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, constructed by Louis IX between 1230 and 1238. The architectural remodeling of the ch\u00e2teau, begun in 1862 by order of Napoleon III and carried out by Eug\u00e8ne Millet, had as its aim the installation of a Mus\u00e9e des Antiquit\u00e9s Celtiques et Gallo-romaines, a goal realized in 1867. The task of historic restoration is always fraught with difficult decisions, but this photograph vividly sums up the Second Empire\u2019s simultaneous enthusiasm for Gothic architecture and its willingness to rebuild and replace the worn vestiges of the past with a shiny new version of a reimagined Middle Ages.",
