    "description": "This work is one of Paul Klee's Magic Square series of oil paintings and watercolors that derive from the 1914 Tunisian watercolors in which he fractured the landscape into squares. They are also related to Klee's preoccupation with the laws of color, prompted by his teaching at the Bauhaus. The squares in this painting might be viewed as odd-shaped stones-in all the colors of the rainbow, to say nothing of the various shades of gray-assembled to form an abstract mosaic.",
