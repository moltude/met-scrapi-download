    "description": "This manuscript leaf was probably the frontispiece for a Book of Psalms. It depicts Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child across the stream. According to legend, when Christ ordered the saint to plant his staff into the ground, it was transformed into a vigorously growing vine bearing leaves and fruit, suggesting his divinity. The refined monumentality of the figure of Saint Christopher recalls a figural style also used in stained-glass compositions and panel painting, and is similar to that of the shrine of the Virgin (17.190.185) exhibited in this gallery.",
