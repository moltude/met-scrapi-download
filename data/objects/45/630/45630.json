    "description": "Imaginary portraits and legends about the life of Prince Sh\u014dtoku (574?\u2013622), the champion of Japanese Buddhism, emerged immediately after his death in 622. This painting of Sh\u014dtoku is based on his biography, which was edited in the mid-Heian period and portrays him as a supernatural being. Painted or sculpted k\u014dy\u014d-z\u014d (portraits of filial piety), such as this example, characterize nearly half of the extant portraits of Sh\u014dtoku. Here, the young prince prays for the recovery from illness of his father, the emperor. He is shown in three-quarter view; dressed incongruously like a monk, he stands on a thin carpet and holds an incense burner.",
