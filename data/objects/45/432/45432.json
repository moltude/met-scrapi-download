The resulting seam is often visible, and the overall shape has an organic appearance. The peach-colored flourishes in the glaze of this piece, unintentionally acquired during firing, add to its charm. Though porcelain was a worldwide phenomenon in the eighteenth century, vessels of this type are unique to Korea.",
