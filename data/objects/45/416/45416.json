    "description": "Echigo (present-day Niigata Prefecture) has long produced high quality ramie (choma) cloth, which was used by the Edo period (1615\u20131868) for the summer clothing of the upper classes. This early-twentieth-century summer kimono may have been made from Echigo chijimi, ramie cr\u00e9pe, characterized by a highly twisted weft. The overall dark blue geometric pattern was done in warp and weft kasuri (ikat). At one time this kimono had long hanging sleeves and was thus a furisode, a form of dress suitable for a young woman.",
