    "description": "The vulpine figure dressed as a traveling monk, gazing intently at a nearby trap, is the protagonist of the popular ky\u014dgen play Tsurigitsune (Fox Hunter). In this comic morality tale, an old fox disguises itself as the monk Hakuz\u014dsu, whose fox-trapper nephew has succeeded in ensnaring most of the fox clan. Recounting a variety of lore about the wily vengeance of the fox, the fox-cum-monk persuades the trapper to give up his trade. This drawing shows the fox prior to heading home, unable to resist the temptation to take the bait from the discarded trap. The trickster ends up caught, to the delight of the chagrined trapper who realizes he has been fooled by a fox in disguise.The poem on the upper left is by the artist's wife, Haruko:Hito wo nomihakaru to omouorokasa nionore kitsune nowana ni kakareri.You who seek to deceivewill find yourselfcaught in the fox trapand foolish.",
