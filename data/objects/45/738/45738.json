    "description": "The center panel depicts the mystical mountain of H\u014drai, the most popular of the auspicious symbols displayed on the New Year in Japan. Balanced on the back of a tortoise, a symbol of longevity, the isle supports other symbols of long life-a crane and pine tree-while plum flowers and the rising sun announce the coming of a new day in a new year.The two flanking panels depict imaginary Chinese landscapes that were inspired by the Chinese scenes in the Eight Views of Xiao and Xiang Rivers. To the right is a spring landscape and to the left, one of winter. The artist of these three panels, a Kano-trained artist, signed his age as sixty-seven. He had achieved the high position of Hokky\u014d (a Buddhist title granted to meritorious artists), yet his dates and life still remain unknown.",
