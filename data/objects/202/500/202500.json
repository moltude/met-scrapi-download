    "description": "These chairs are part of a large set that included two settees and one winged easy chair, stools, and side chairs, supplied to Sir Robert Walpole, later first Earl of Orford (1676\u20131745), for Houghton Hall, Norfolk. The attribution to Richard Roberts is based on an account of a considerable debt owed by Walpole in 1729 to a \"Thomas Roberts.\" Thomas Roberts, carver and joiner to the royal household, worked in London under the sign of The Royal Chair until his death in 1714. He was succeeded by Richard Roberts, presumably his son, who was active at the time that Walpole redecorated Houghton Hall.",
