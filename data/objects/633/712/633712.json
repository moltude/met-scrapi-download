    "description": "The Metropolitan Museum of Art has possessed the sculpture of the Three Magi offering their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh in its collection since 1951. The recent acquisition of the Virgin and Child has provided the Museum with the exceptional opportunity to reunite these sculptures, originally part of the large altarpiece dismantled in the early nineteenth century. Altarpieces depicting the Adoration of the Magi were widespread in Germany during the late Middle Ages, particularly following the city of Cologne\u2019s acquisition of the Magi\u2019s relics in 1164.It has been proposed that the first two Magi, Melchoir and Balthazar, might depict the Hapsburg emperor Maximilian I and his son, Philip.",
