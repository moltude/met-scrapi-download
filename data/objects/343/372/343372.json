    "description": "Auguste Herbst was a very versatile artist who is mainly known for his work in the firm of Emile Gall\u00e9 (French, Nancy 1846\u20131904 Nancy). As one of his companions and chief designers, Herbst made designs for glass, ceramics and even marquetry, which were produced in Gall\u00e9\u2019s workshops in Strasbourg and Nancy. After Gall\u00e9 died in 1914, Herbst continued to design for the Gall\u00e9 firm and numerous of his designs for glassware and ceramics are still kept in museum collections. This design for a room decorated with magnolias must have been one of his earlier works. While fitting in well with current developments in interior decoration, the room has a very distinct character. In his interior, Herbst combines a natural rendering of the magnolia tree, growing in an arch-shape around the door, and even throwing shadows on the pink background, with a more stylized pattern reminiscent of contemporary Arts & Crafts designs, seen in the pattern of the rose wall panels and across the ceiling.",
