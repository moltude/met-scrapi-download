    "description": "The elegant decoration of this glazed wall tile found in a surface survey near the eastern Iranian city of Nishapur was made possible in part by the introduction of a new body fabric to the region. The tile is made from stonepaste, a fabric composed mostly of ground quartz with an admixture of clay, which was introduced to Iran at some point in the late eleventh century. Stonepaste differs substantially from the traditional earthenware used to make ceramics at Nishapur, which was composed mostly of clay. Being substantially stronger than earthenware, stonepaste takes well to decorative techniques such as the deep-cut carving seen on this tile, allowing for more intricate, layered decorations. The design here consists of a band of Arabic calligraphy set against a background of scrolling vines. The sense of foreground and background in the inscription is achieved through the varying levels at which the letters and vegetal motifs are carved. The pooling of the transparent turquoise glaze into the crevices amplifies the effect.",
