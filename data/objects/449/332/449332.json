    "description": "Bowls made with boldly colored slips (diluted clay) were made throughout the area surrounding Nishapur. These slip wares are easily distinguished from the ceramics produced in the rest of the Abbasid Empire, and bear no relation to the popular Chinese-style ceramics also produced in Nishapur. Similar rosettes decorate bowls from other nearby sites, including Samarqand, but the peculiar leaf design is more common in the finds from Nishapur. This small bowl was probably made for daily household use.",
