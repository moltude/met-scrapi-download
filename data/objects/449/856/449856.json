    "description": "This is one of several similar, unidentifiable fragments found during the Nishapur excavations. It features a pointed niche with a staff with three lobes at each end in the center, flanked by several bird-headed figures.  The letters within the point of the niche (at the bottom of this fragment) appear to read 'aml Muhammad, or \"the work of Muhammad,\" but they are written upside down, and not reversed, as they would be in a mold. Although it does resemble a jewelry mold, this object\u2019s function is still to be determined, and its unusual imagery does not point to a specific use.",
