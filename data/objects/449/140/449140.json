    "description": "This five-sided vessel is unique among the material excavated from Nishapur in eastern Iran by the Metropolitan Museum. A rare shape in general, its specific use is difficult to determine. In terms of scale, it is comparable to the metal lamps excavated at the site. Its form, however, does not seem suitable for a lamp, as there is no conceivable place for a wick. It is more likely that this piece served as a dish.",
