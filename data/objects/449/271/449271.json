    "description": "Spindle whorls aided in the making of thread by maintaining the momentum of the spindle. This conically shaped bone spindle whorl was excavated at Nishapur. It is decorated with two stylized letter-like inscriptions, possibly undeciphered Kufic, on either side of the central hole and a bottom border of two incised lines with dots in between; all incisions were inlaid with dark colored paste. Hundreds of spindle whorls were excavated at Nishapur, providing further evidence that the city possessed a thriving textile industry. Their incised designs exhibit a wide variety of motifs ranging from geometric forms to zoomorphic figures.",
