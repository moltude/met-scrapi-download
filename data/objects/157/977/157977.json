    "description": "This dramatic coat is very indicative of the Art Nouveau style which was popular at the turn of the century.  The sinuous curves of the textile and the symmetrical seaming make this exemplary of the House of Worth's design aesthetic which was well retained throughout its run.  Jean-Philippe Worth began as an assistant to his father, Charles Frederick Worth, in 1875.  Gradually he was allowed to create his own designs and when his father died in 1895, he became the lead designer for the house.  He was praised for making elaborate artistic gowns with intricate trimmings on unique textiles, much like his father had before him.  Although the House of Worth was still favored by royalty and celebrities through the turn of the century, their styles were no longer the forefront of French fashion after 1900.  Around 1910 Jean-Philippe limited his design work to important orders and hired his nephew, Jean-Charles Worth, as the new lead designer before leaving the company entirely after World War I.",
