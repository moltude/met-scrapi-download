    "description": "During World War II, traditional materials used in millinery such as silk and wool were rationed for use by the military. Therefore, millinery designers had to adapt the \"make do\" attitude and be creative with materials, sometimes employing unusual choices. This whimsical design by successful milliner John P. John of John Frederics, Inc., personifies this attitude, incorporating pipe cleaners, strands of sequins and braided straw to fashion a twisted swirl.",
