    "description": "The variations in the embroidered motifs of the center stripe of this belt, worn by either a man or a woman, are very intricate and worked in fascinating detail. The zigzag and diamond motif repeats at intervals, separating the other individual motifs, each of which varies. The motifs are undoubtedly symbolic. It is important to note that while this object is identified as being from Yugoslavia, that entity in the Balkan region did not exist until after World War I--first as the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, then, after 1929, as Yugoslavia (\u201cland of south Slavs\").",
