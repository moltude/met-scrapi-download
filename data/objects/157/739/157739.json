    "description": "Although both day and evening wear was developing a cleaner silhouette and a more masculine air in the years after World War I, lingerie was free to maintain a dainty femininity suitable to the bedroom, as can be seen in this charming boudoir cap.  The sculpted appearance and light, airy look is effected through the use of ruffled pleating, streamers, and lace.  While earlier boudoir caps tended to be in the mob cap style, with a puffed crown corresponding to the fuller hairstyles, this cap's close, low fit parallels the cloche style of day hats and the jeweled evening caps just coming into fashion.",
