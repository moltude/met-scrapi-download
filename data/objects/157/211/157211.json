    "description": "First established in the 1890s by the four Callot sisters as a lingerie and lace business, Callot Soeurs evolved into a premier dressmaking house in the early years of the 20th century.  Madame Gerber, the eldest Callot sister, served as the primary designer for the house. Many accessories from Callot Soeurs in the Brooklyn Museum collections incorporate a signature element: antique lace trimming. Rita de Acosta Lydig (1880-1929), a noted beauty and style icon of the early twentieth century, owned this handbag attributed to Callot Soeurs. A great admirer and collector of lace, de Acosta Lydig patronized Callot Soeurs in appreciation of Madame Gerber's similar affinity and skillful use of antique textiles. She may have provided lace from her own collection to be made up into garments and accessories by Madame Gerber.",
