    "description": "Transitioning from the popular S-curve silhouette, this fashionable and eye-catching dress is more streamlined, with a slightly raised waist, introducing a more modern look.  What is of most interest is the surprising combination of materials, using both polka dots and paisley patterns.  Both of these prints have sustained the fashion cycle and remain familiar to our twentieth century eye.",
