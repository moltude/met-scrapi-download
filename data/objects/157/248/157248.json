    "description": "As sun tanning and outdoor sports were first popularized in the 1920s, the appropriate clothes for these activities were required.  The playsuit was a comfortable garment that could be worn for beach and pool activities.  The piece featured here has a striking visual appeal, due its playful use of the harlequin pattern.  The high quality of this playsuit is noted by the hand screened or possible stenciled print fabric.  The owner, Millicent Rogers, was a woman of style, this piece befitting her individual look.",
