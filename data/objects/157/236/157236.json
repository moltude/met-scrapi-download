    "description": "Rita de Acosta Lydig (1880-1929), a noted beauty and style icon of the early twentieth century, owned this garment. Born in Spain, de Acosta Lydig was known for her striking combination of dark hair and pale skin. A great admirer and collector of lace, de Acosta Lydig's garments and accessories often incorporated insertions of antique lace.  Blouses made partially or completely of lace like this example, were a fixture of her wardrobe. De Acosta Lydig favored dramatic and slightly idiosyncratic styles in dressing, including dhoti-style culottes. She often wore dark colors that emphasized both her complexion and her favorite lace garments and accessories. This blouse is intricately constructed of laces that are contemporaneous or slightly older than the garment.",
