    "description": "One of the most recognizable and interesting aspects of Dutch costume is the ear-iron. The Frisian style of this headwear is a wide band of metal fitting around the back of the head with ornaments at the temples. The shape and style of the ornaments were indicative of their status, their husband's or son's profession, their locality, or even their religion. This example, also pictured with the traditional lace cap (2009.300.1690a, b) is made of brass, as opposed to the more expensive silver or gold.",
