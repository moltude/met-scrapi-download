    "description": "Gloves predominance changed from the seventeenth century to the twentieth, from being extremely popular, to almost unnecessary.  By the end of the nineteenth century and into the first part of the twentieth, gloves were worn for particular day and evening activities.  Tight fitting gloves, in varying lengths and colors were in vogue and worn by both men and women. This pair of gloves is part of a gift of unworn fine French gloves.  Each pair provides an interesting visual document of the many lengths that gloves were produced in. This is the second, from short to long, of eight lengths represented of the 86 from this donor, which range from 4\" to 26\" measured from the bottom of the thumb to hem.  They were all made in France of the finest materials and craftsmanship.  The intricate overstitching and gussets between the fingers are characteristic of fine workmanship.",
