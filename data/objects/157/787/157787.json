    "description": "During the 1970s, feminists proclaimed the need of women to free themselves from limitations and restraints. A symbol of this movement was the eschewal of objects which forced femininity on women such as hairspray, false eyelashes and the brassiere. Not all women prescribed to this viewpoint and still wanted to wear a bra with some form of coverage and support. With the introduction of Rudi Gernreich's \"No Bra\" in 1964 (see 2009.300.2910), bras became less complicated and restrictive. Instead of forcing the bust into a certain fashionable silhouette, a woman's natural form could be maintained, while still providing some form of coverage and support, however minimal.",
