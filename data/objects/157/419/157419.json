    "description": "This ski mask was sold by the retailer, Pi\u00f1ata Party. Pi\u00f1ata Party, Inc was a New York store specializing in Peruvian merchandise. Founded in 1957, George Grossblatt and Stanley Selengut had the idea for the enterprise while traveling in South America. In addition to selling pre-Columbian art, they employed more than 2,000 Indian craftsmen to create clothing, handcrafts, and folk art. Despite the name, pi\u00f1atas constituted only a very small portion of their stock. Their most successful items were fur hats and slippers, and ski masks.",
