    "description": "Though several predecessors of the car were introduced in the 1890s, the more recognized forms, such as the Model T, were introduced in the first decade of the 20th century. Early automobiles had open tops, or at the very least, a convertible top. Drivers were often exposed to dust, dirt and various weather conditions, and therefore had to wear appropriate clothing. This pair of motoring goggles is a well-made example of a component of the motoring ensemble. The ensemble could include a duster, a hat, with a veil that covered the face for women, and gloves. The eye pieces on this pair are constructed on a slant with screw fittings on the lense frames for removal. This type of construction provides for ease of replacement,  increased visibility and protection for the entire eye, including the sides. These goggles snapped onto a larger head covering, which substituted for a hat.",
