    "description": "This pair of pajamas features a bold and interesting print which was probably hand-blocked.  The minimalist cut of the tabard is of interest showing that this is a well-made piece.  Highly aesthetic, the white patterning incorporating un-dyed black spaces gives the appearance of looking beyond the surface. Upon closer inspection, it is clear that the pattern shares in similarities to those produced by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte and Poiret's Martine.  The stitching marks in the printed fabric of the tabard clearly indicate that this is from another garment which has been recycled to create this piece.",
