    "description": "This object comes from a group of over seventy-five shoe prototypes designed in Paris in 1939 by Steven Arpad.  Aside from the lines of leather accessories and jewelry he produced under his own name in the 1940s, Arpad seems to have worked mostly anonymously. The prototypes are accompanied by an extensive archive of original sketches which has made it possible to identify uncredited shoe designs for Balenciaga and Delman as Arpad's work. Containing some of the most creative, unique, and unusual examples of footwear design in the collection, the museum's holdings appear to be the only documented body of the work of this extraordinary designer.The contemporary trend for walled square toes serves as a point of exaggeration in this appealing design.  Similar toe shapes were used by other innovative designers at this time, such as Salvatore Ferragamo.  In typical Arpad style, the curve of the toe is mirrored in the profile of the wedge heel",
