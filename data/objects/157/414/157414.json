    "description": "While Jeanne Lanvin gained inspiration from numerous historical and cultural sources throughout her career, in the 1920s, the decorative arts of China and Japan were in prominent evidence in her collections. In this example, the classic cloche form features gold embroidery in concentric lines and wave patterns inspired by Chinese Imperial robes of the Qing dynasty. Sheer hats with shimmering decorative elements were favored for evening wear; they drew focus to the face and were a replacement for jewelry at neck and ears.",
