    "description": "Featured here is an amusing reinterpretation of a classic regimental-striped man's tie into a woman's dress belt.  This trend was made fashionable by the actor and dancer Fred Astaire, who preferred to tighten his pants with a tie rather than a traditional belt.  This piece is very well-made and has a visually stunning color combination. Additionally, the leather lining of the buckle is indicative of its fine quality.",
