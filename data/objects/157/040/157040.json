    "description": "The collapsible opera hat shows the continued use of a practical form dating from the19th century into the 20th century. Built upon a collapsible frame, the hat, when closed, fits discreetly under the gentleman's seat at a theater or opera. The style first appeared during the 1810s, however, it was a French maker, Antoine Gibus, who perfected the design in the 1840s. As a result, a hat of this style is sometimes known as a \"gibus.\" Unlike fixed top hats, opera hats were covered in faille, which would not be crushed as fur or plush would be when the hat was flattened. By the 20th century, the collapsible form proved to be well-suited for the needs of the traveler, as well as the theater or opera patron.",
