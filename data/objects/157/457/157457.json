    "description": "Dr\u00e9coll was founded in 1896 by Christoff von Dr\u00e9coll in Vienna, Austria where he designed fashions for the Imperial family of Austria.  In 1902, a couture house was opened in Paris and run by Monsieur and Madame Besancon de Wagner.  Their daughter Maggie Rouff was a talented designer, working for the house first and then later managing the business with her husband Pierre beginning in 1929.  Eventually, the house merged with the House of Beer and then in 1931 they merged with the House of Agness, closing in 1963.The classic pannier draping and long pointed train of this dress indicates the highest style of the period.  Beautiful in shape and style, the piece is an elegant combination of refined materials and intricate handwork.  A well-thought out and interesting detail, the semi-circular shape of the brooch mimics the shape of the bodice.",
