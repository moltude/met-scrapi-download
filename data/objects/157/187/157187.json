    "description": "Claire McCardell is remembered as a pioneer of American fashion.  After studying at Parsons and living in Paris, she returned to America to design functional, affordable clothes for the American woman.  Her simple use of natural fabrics, such as cotton, denim and wool combined with flattering silhouettes filled a vacancy in women's fashion.  Her first success was the tent-shaped Monastic dress, which had no form, but when belted became body-revealing and flattering.  For the length of her career, McCardell designed inventive, sometimes daring looks that were mass-produced down to every last spaghetti tie and brass hook.This day ensemble is a classic McCardell design of wool jersey.  Characteristic of her work, the bodice of the dress is a halter style and the closures used are utilitarian brass hooks.  The addition of the shrug adds versatility to the dress, and allows the wearer to be comfortable in cool or warm climates.  The kerchief necktie adds a jaunty finish to the ensemble.",
