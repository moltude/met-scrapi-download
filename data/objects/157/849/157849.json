    "description": "Part of the appeal of this parasol is the novelty of its being made from glass beads, which are more typical for handbags prevalent in the nineteenth century.  The unusual decorative touch to this particular parasol is the addition of lamb's wool fringe instead of the usual silk fringes.  It is an excellent example of the frivolity of fashion for the upper classes during this period.",
