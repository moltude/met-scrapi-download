    "description": "This parasol is an example of the combination of fine jewelry work as well as fine craftsmanship for umbrella/parasol making.  This was either a presentation piece or a gift, as indicated by the inscription on the ring.  A very expensive item, the lace appliqu\u00e9s are handmade.  The combination of black and white was quite prevalent in the post-1908 period and this fine accessory marks the beginning of that trend.  The provenance adds extra interest as it was donated by the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust established in 1938.",
