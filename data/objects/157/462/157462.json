    "description": "Today's savvy fashion consumer is acquainted with myriad designer logos which boldly announce the wearer's pretense to taste, status, and membership in the \"in crowd\" of their choosing.  The display of designer logos is not a new phenomenon, but the practice of buying and using boldly brand-emblazoned apparel witnessed a notable expansion in the 1970s which has continued to this day. This umbrella figures early into the craze for logo-centric design by featuring the well-known silhouette parade that had been the iconic imagery of Bergdorf Goodman packaging since [date?].  Despite its exclusive pedigree, the umbrella is inexpensively made, and was presumably given away to customers as a marketing tool.  Plastic and vinyl had a clean, modernistic connotation, and were used extensively in fashion and rainwear in this period.",
