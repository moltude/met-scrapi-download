    "description": "Rita de Acosta Lydig (1880-1929), a noted beauty and style icon of the early twentieth century, owned this garment. A great admirer and collector of lace, de Acosta Lydig's garments and accessories often incorporated insertions of the antique lace. Born in Spain, de Acosta Lydig was known for her striking combination of dark hair, pale skin and a swan-like neck, which she accentuated with high-necked blouses like this example. De Acosta Lydig favored dramatic and slightly idiosyncratic styles in dressing, including dhoti-style culottes. She often wore dark colors that emphasized both her complexion and her favorite lace garments and accessories.Unlike many of the other Lydig pieces in the collection that emply antique laces, the lace here is contemporaneous with, or possible slgihtly older than,  the  blouse.",
