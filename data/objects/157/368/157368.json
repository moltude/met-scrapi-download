    "description": "This parasol is of the highest quality, produced by Tiffany & Co.  The label is of great interest, showing Tiffany & Co.'s Union Square address.  Sterling silver was introduced to the United States in 1852, and afterwards, Charles Lewis Tiffany contracted John C. Moore to produce silverware exclusively for Tiffany's.  At this new address, Moore was given his own workshop.  During the Gilded Age, the company held a dominant presence in the American market, making luxury goods to satisfy their clients wants and desires.",
