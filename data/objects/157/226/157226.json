    "description": "Schiaparelli often commissioned prints exclusively for her use, such as the 1935 press-clippings print which featured several newspaper articles about her success in various languages and the French regimental flag print (see 2009.300.2405). This particular blouse printed with a whimsical postage stamp design was worn by Millicent Rogers, fashion icon and granddaughter of Standard Oil Senior Executive Henry Huttleston Rogers. The print, and the thoughtful construction of the blouse that showcases the motifs in a pleasing configuration, is a good example of the individual and unique types of patterns she enjoyed. According to Dilys Blum's \"Shocking! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli,\" the blouse was originally designed for airwoman Amy Johnson's wardrobe for her record-breaking flight from England to South Africa in 1936.",
