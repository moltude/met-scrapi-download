    "description": "Evening dress during the 1920s was more daring and showy than it had been in the past.  Short, tubular dresses made of sheer fabrics, heavily beaded were in vogue, and accessorized with hose, heels, costume jewels and a bobbed haircut.  With such a revealing outfit, coats were necessary, and no ordinary coat would do.  The evening coat featured is an example of the visually pleasing pieces produced to enhance an ensemble.  The cut of the coat is very similar to that of the eighteenth century, while the printing technique used and the design is typical of the Art Deco period.",
