    "description": "During World War II, women on the home front wore red, white and blue garments as a means of showing support for the troops and the nation at war, but this jaunty clutch makes an even more obvious statement. A woman carrying this bag proudly advertised her patriotic sentiments. Probably a novelty item, the bag is comprised of a surprising and creative combination of materials -- straw, felt and plastic -- assembled to create a vivid symbol of American pride. The flag itself, which covers the entire oversized flap, has only forty-eight stars, an indication that the bag was made prior to 1959, when Alaska became the forty-ninth state.",
