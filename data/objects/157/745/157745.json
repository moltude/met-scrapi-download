    "description": "Introduced to American men in the early part of the 20th century, the panama hat survives as a classic style still worn to combat the heat of summer or of the tropics. The hat's characteristic material, a light-colored fine flexible straw, allows it to be rolled and packed, making it ideal for travel. Adopted by workers building the Panama Canal (1904-1914), the style became associated with that country, rather than Ecuador, where it originated. High-quality hats are traditionally made in the town of Montechristi, as the label of this hat attests. When Theodore Roosevelt donned a panama hat during his landmark visit to the Canal in 1906, he contributed to the popularity of the style for American men.",
