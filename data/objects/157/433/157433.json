    "description": "The 1920s was a fashionable period, introducing a new silhouette.  Long skirts, frills and tiers of lace were exchanged for a tubular silhouette, short skirts, and diaphanous fabrics decorated with heavy beading.  With such sheer and revealing dresses, coats were much in vogue.  The evening coat featured here is an excellent example of the different styles that were available and that were deemed stylish.  This interpretation of a Chinese robe worked in quilting is quite stunning and shows how non-Western design influenced fashion.",
