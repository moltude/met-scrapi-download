    "description": "Seen here, is a nice example of a typical carriage parasol of the 1860s.  The contrast of colors of the canopy and the lace is very appealing and showcases the lace.  Also, the black lace is a nice complement to the rich lustrous ivory.  Carriage parasols, taken when riding in an open carriage, were popularized by Queen Victoria in the 1840s and continued to be for several decades afterwards.  The provenance adds extra interest as it was donated by the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust established in 1938.",
