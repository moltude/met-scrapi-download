    "description": "Masterful featherwork is one hallmark of the French milliner. In this example by renowned Parisian hat-maker Rose Valois, the skillful application of smooth feathers in layers flat against the form of the hat appears to create an extension of the wearer's hairstyle, while the softly pleated body resembles the turban headdresses of the ealy 1800s. The overall effect of the hat, heightened by its shape and the dramatic combination of colors, is that of an aureole for the woman who wore it.",
