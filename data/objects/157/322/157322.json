    "description": "The 1920s was the era of the flapper - a liberated woman who danced all night, sipped cocktails and frequently smoked.  She was a carefree spirit and this was expressed through her dress.  Hemlines rose and waistlines dropped, creating a tubular silhouette.  Sheer and delicate fabrics were used, revealing more skin, and heavy beading was a common adornment, for the beads would catch the light and sparkle while the wearer was in motion.  For a fabulous night on the town, a lady had to have the appropriate wardrobe and this evening dress is a perfect example of a well-made dress of the period.  It is a visually appealing piece with the combination of the ombr\u00e9 fabric and the refined beadwork.  The floating panels on the skirt are a classic design element of the 1920s dresses and would have been quite eye-catching while the wearer danced the Charleston and the Black Bottom.",
