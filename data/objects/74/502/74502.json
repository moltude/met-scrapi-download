Each of Durga\u2019s eight arms displays a weapon lent to her by the male gods for this task. This shrine, with its distinctive temple towers, evokes the architecture of Himachal Pradesh, as does the lotus-petal nimbus framing the goddess\u2019s head, a motif specific to imagery of the Chamba Valley region.",
