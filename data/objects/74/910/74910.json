    "description": "This depiction of Avalokitesvara is part of a group of illuminations from a dispersed manuscript. This text was understood to contain the totality of Mahayana ideology in eight thousand verses. As the placement of Avalokitesvara and the other deities does not relate to the content of the text, it appears that their function relates to treating the book as an object to be venerated, the interspersed Buddhist having auspicious and protective roles. The text is written in a black carbon-based ink, while the illustrations were executed in mineral- and vegetable-based pigments.",
