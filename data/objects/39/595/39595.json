    "description": "An arrangement of floral medallions interspersed with quatrefoil motifs was one of the dominant textile patterns of the High Tang period (roughly the first half of the eighth century). A textile with a similar large floral medallion has been preserved as part of the Sh\u014ds\u014d-in collection from the mid-eighth-century imperial repository in Nara, Japan. However, an aspect of this work's weave structure\u2014namely, that it is bound in weft-faced twill on both the face and the reverse\u2014is more commonly seen in textiles of the tenth century and later.",
