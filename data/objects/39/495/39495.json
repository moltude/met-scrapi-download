A piece similar to the example seen here was found in the burial pagoda in Beijing of the Buddhist monk Haiyun (1203\u20131257), an important figure at the court of the early Mongol Empire. The rhythmic background of leaves and flowers also recalls the densely patterned Central Asian silks woven with gold that are preserved in European church treasuries.",
