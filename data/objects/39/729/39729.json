    "description": "Few silks better represent the imagination and vitality of Central Asian textiles of the Mongol period than this piece, with its angry birds and strange, incomplete winged beasts against an airy floral background. Other Central Asian textiles of this type survive in European church treasuries and show dynamic interactions among the various imaginary creatures of their patterns. Such designs had a strong effect on fourteenth- to fifteenth-century Italian silks, which are known for their energy and humor.",
