    "description": "This tender image of maternal affection depicts the child Krishna being nursed by his foster mother, Yashoda. In infancy Krishna had been hidden from the murderous king Kamsa of Mathura to be raised in safety by foster parents. In the repertoire of South Indian processional bronzes cast during the Chola period, this subject is rarely represented. The sophisticated modeling, casting, and tooling link this work to Chola bronzes of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries.",
