    "description": "This jacket (su\u014d), with its field of graphically rendered lotuses, would be worn with matching long trousers in ky\u014dgen plays for the role of a samurai lord. Ky\u014dgen is a comic form of Japanese theater, performed along with the more serious noh drama. Historically, ky\u014dgen players had two functions. First, between acts of noh, they explicated in the vernacular the play\u2019s poetic language. Second, during a conventional full-day program of noh theater, they performed in plays that were interspersed for comic relief. Costumes for ky\u014dgen are noted for their bold resist-dyed patterns on linenlike asa, as opposed  to noh costumes\u2019 more elegant woven or embroidered silk.",
