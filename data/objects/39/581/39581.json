    "description": "This mountain landscape, in which the human presence is but a minor aspect of the vastness of nature, draws on an archetypal motif in East Asian art first formulated by Song-dynasty painters in the tenth century. The eighteenth-century painter Soga Sh\u014dhaku took liberties with tradition in this landscape. His vision of nature is more foreboding than grand, and the minute humans seem more in peril than in harmony with their strangely animated environment. At the edge of a precipice in the left foreground a gentleman sits contemplating a distant waterfall, unaware of the improbably huge splash that arches up over him like a dragon. To the right a single traveler crosses a mountain ravine on a precarious bridge. He seems to be making his way toward the temple at far right, but the path disappears in light-filled mist. In the distance skeletal trees on barren mountaintops accentuate the forbidding nature of the vast landscape.Sh\u014dhaku was notorious for his eccentric treatment of conventional themes. He was one of a growing group of painters who worked in styles that challenged the orthodox manner of the dominant Kano school, which enjoyed the sponsorship of the Tokugawa shogunate.",
