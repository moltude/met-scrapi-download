    "description": "The Sentani people of northwest New Guinea live in villages built over thewaters of Lake Sentani, a large inland lake. Sentani houses are constructedon wood pilings and are linked by raised boardwalks, allowing the residents towalk around the village. Until the early 1920s, the most imposing structures inmost Sentani villages were the houses of the hereditary chiefs. These houseswere lavishly decorated with architectural carvings on the pilings that supportedthe roof and floor. The carvings were of two basic types: tall Y-shaped posts, such as the present work, which supported the central roof beam, and human imagescarved atop the pilings that supported the floor.  Like all Sentani roof supports, thiswork is made from a single inverted tree.  Originally, the upper trunk was sunk intothe lake bed, while the flaring roots formed the wing-like projections at the top, at whose junction the roof beam rested. Beyond structural considerations, the inversion of the tree may refer to the cosmic tree in Sentani religion, which grew downward from the heavens to the earth. The shaft is adorned with S-shaped spirals, possibly representing clouds hovering between the earth and sky.  The openwork wings incorporate stylized lizards, which crawl inward toward the trunk.",
