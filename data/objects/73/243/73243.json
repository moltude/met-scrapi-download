    "description": "These colophons were written on two sheets of decorated paper\u2014one oriented vertically, the other horizontally\u2014which Xie subsequently mounted together. The letter paper is printed with a pale blue image of blossoming plums, along with Xie's studio name, Zhuangmu Tang, or \"Hall of a Spirited Old Man.\" On the first sheet, Xie composed a colophon for his own painting of the scenery near Mount Yan, in northern China, where he traveled in September 1987. (The painting was executed in March of the following year.) The second sheet bears a colophon for an unidentified painting by the monk-painter Kuncan (1612\u20131673). Xie commented particularly on the calligraphy of Kuncan's inscription.",
