Among the birds are cranes (at the shoulder and hem on the back), ducks (including mandarin ducks on the back of the left sleeve), pheasants, sparrows, and swallows, as well as a peacock that wraps dramatically around the entire garment. This spectacular kimono was among the robes worn by a bride for her wedding celebration, which took place in 1942.",
