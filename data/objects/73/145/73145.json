    "description": "Reeds (ashi), which grow along shorelines and riverbanks throughout Japan, have often inspired melancholy autumnal poetry. Sometimes, as in this summer garment, they are coupled with waterfowl. The reeds and the sagi (a word that refers to both herons and egrets) on this robe were reserved in white on the dark background. Details of the grasses, feathers, and beak were painted in, and the eyes and crests at the tops of the birds\u2019 heads were enhanced with touches of embroidery.",
