    "description": "The tableware for the first-class dining room included extensive silver, glass, and porcelain services that were at once elegant and sturdy.  Most pieces were marked with the concentric monogram CGT, the initials of the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique which owned the Normandie.The reductive, geometric simplicity of Luc Lanel's silver-plated Transat service (made by Christofle) is recalled by its name, an abbreviation of the French \"transatlantique\" and a nickname for the C.G.T. (included here are serving dishes, a crumber with tray, a condiment holder, an oil-and-vinegar cruet, a champagne bucket, a candlestick, and a teapot with creamer).  While some glassware was provided by famous firm Daum, the more functional pieces displayed here were made in heat- and break-resistant glass manufactured by the French company Duralex.  The two porcelains services, one by Suzanne Lalique (daughter of the renowned jeweler and glassmaker Ren\u00e9-Jules Lalique) and the other by Jean Luce, were both manufactured by Haviland, in Limoges.",
