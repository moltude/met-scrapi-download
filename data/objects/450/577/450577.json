    "description": "Here, the radial blue stripes are bounded by two calligraphic bands painted on the stonepaste body in black pigment. The letters, etched through the pigment to reveal the white body\u2011fabric below, form an illegible pseudo\u2011inscription that may have had associations with magic. The motif of swimming fish, frequently depicted on Chinese wares, gained popularity in Kashan ceramics. The juxtaposition of fish with magical letters reinforces the idea that the bowl had talismanic properties.",
