    "description": "This drawing depicts Majnun in the desert chucking a fawn under the chin. The Arab boy Qais earned the name  Majnun, meaning 'mad one', because he fell in love with Layla and his unrequited desire drove him crazy. Eventually he left his tribe and went to live in the desert, where he befriended the animals. This drawing was probably not intended as a manuscript illustration, but would have been placed in an album.",
