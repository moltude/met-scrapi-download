    "description": "With its exquisite palette and elegant scrolling vine design, this tile, one of three corner tiles, once formed part of a sumptuous architectural installation. Inscribed with verses of the Qur'an, the tiles presumably decorated a religious structure, such as a mosque or tomb complex. The inscription that runs along the top of one of these tiles would have continued in the form of a frieze\u2014as can be seen in the series of related tiles on display in the nearby wall case.",
