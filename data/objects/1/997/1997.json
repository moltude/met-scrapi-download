    "description": "The richest and most vigorous early colonial carving is that  associated with the work of William Searle (1634\u20131667) and Thomas Dennis (1638\u20131706) of Ipswich. Paired leaves, with a naturalistic,  three-dimensional quality rare in American furniture of the period, dominate the panels of this chest; the panels are carved in the  popular seventeenth-century design of a stalk of flowers and leaves  emerging from an urn, of which only the opening is indicated here. Searle and Dennis came from Devonshire, England, where a tradition of  florid carving, using many of the motifs seen on this chest, flourished in the early seventeenth century.",
