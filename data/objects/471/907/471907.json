    "description": "The church of San Baudelio in northern Castilla was originally decorated with a complete cycle of wall paintings depicting the life of Christ above a row illustrating hunting scenes and various exotic animals. The New Testament scenes can be ascribed to a master who worked on the paintings at Santa Maria de Ta\u00fcll, in the province of Lleida (L\u00e9rida). According to contemporary accounts, animals were represented in fresco cycles \"for adornment and beauty only\" and did not have symbolic functions.",
