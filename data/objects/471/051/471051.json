The group, which may have originally been made for the main portal, was, at a later date, set into a side wall of the church at Cerezo de Riotir\u00f3n. the rhythmic pleats, hook folds, and blocky masses of the figures are characteristic of Castillian sculpture in the late 12th century.See also 30.77.6, .8, .9.",
