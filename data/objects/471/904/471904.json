    "description": "The deep emotional piety shown in these expressive faces and gestures is made more poignant by the weighty drapery folds modeled by sharply contrasted highlights and shadows, by the vivid coloring, and by the taut composition.  The unknown artist has been linked to a miniature painter who illuminated several manuscripts, including a life of Saint George in the Vatican for Cardinal Stefaneschi, resident at the papal court in Avignon from 1309 1341, and a missal, probably for the same patron, in the Morgan Library and Museum, New York.  Also in the Museum's collection is a companion panel, \"The Lamentation.\"  Both were part of a larger ensemble of hinged panels, two others of which are preserved in Florence.  Such a work would have been, in effect, a folding portable altar.",
