    "description": "According to legend, St. Margaret was imprisoned for refusing to marry the governor of Antioch. Satan appeared to her in the form of a dragon and swallowed her as she clutched a cross in prayer; she then ripped open his belly with the cross and emerged unscathed. The statue may have held a cross in one of her now-missing hands; the vanquished dragon lies at her feet. This massive figure probably came from the central shrine of a large polychromed altarpiece.",
