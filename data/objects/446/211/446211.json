    "description": "This textile fragment and is ornamented with circular medallions containing eight-pointed stars and large multi-lobed arabesques, alternating pyramidal merlons, and stylized palm trees flanked by confronting birds.Geometric patterns such as the ones in this fragment are found ornamenting a wide variety of media produced in Nasrid period (1232\u20131492) Spain, including tile work, woodwork, book binding, and painted stucco. Such colorful geometric designs also recall the famous wall patterns in the Alhambra palace in Granada. In both the plaster and tile work of the buildings in the palace, interlacery designs are closely related to this weaving.",
