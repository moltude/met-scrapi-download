    "description": "Moholy-Nagy played a key role at the Bauhaus in Weimar and Dessau as a painter, graphic artists, teacher, and impassioned advocate of avant-garde photography. In 1923, he began making collages of images he clipped from magazines and newspapers, which he then re-photographed and furnished with enigmatic and allusive titles, creating visual riddles to be deciphered by the viewer. In this composition of two circles connected by perspectival lines, a young woman athlete appears to be jumping or falling through empty space from one world into another in a tremendous leap of faith.",
