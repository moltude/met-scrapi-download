    "description": "The carefully composed sporting still life of a day's catch and related fishing accoutrements is a fine study in form and texture as well as a typical example of the subjects preferred by the gentleman amateur photographer in mid-nineteenth-century Great Britain.  Such artists banded together to form clubs and societies where members could exchange ideas, technical advice, and pictures.  This image was included in an album compiled in London in 1869 by the Amateur Photographic Association.",
