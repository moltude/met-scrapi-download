    "description": "Before becoming a staff photographer for Life magazine in 1944, Kessel specialized in industrial photography.  Although it is reminiscent of Sheeler's Upper Deck in subject matter, this photograph emphasizes the function of the machinery rather than its form.  The foreground floorboards lead diagonally to the door that accesses the machinery below deck, and the weathered surface of the metal constructions suggests the presence of the crew that works there.  In contrast, Sheeler composed his photograph so that the masses are barely contained within the edges of the frame, creating a dynamic symphony of lines, volumes and surfaces.",
