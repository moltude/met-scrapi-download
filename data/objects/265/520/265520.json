    "description": "Trained as a painter, Gutmann fled Germany for America in 1933.  In need of money, the artist began photographing across the country as a foreign correspondent for the tremendously popular picture magazines of his homeland, which had an insatiable appetite for all things American.  What began as an assignment in exile--travelling from New York, Chicago, and Detroit to New Orleans and San Francisco--became a remarkable lifelong career in a new medium and country.One of the earliest and most inventive practitioners of street photography, Gutmann was one of the great poets and chroniclers of a particularly American kind of city life--the endless supply of characters and spontaneous dramas set against a backdrop of skyscrapers, signs, and graffiti.",
