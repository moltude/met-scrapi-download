    "description": "Following his service in World War I as chief of Allied aerial-reconnaissance photography, and prior to his highly successful career as chief photographer for Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines, Steichen experimented with giving abstract meanings to very literal photographs.  The transparent bowl, floating planes, and elemental mineral substances of this picture evole an austere cosmos, while the locksmith's repertory of standard key profiles suggests the inadequacy of all codes, other than Einstein's, for unlocking the universe.",
