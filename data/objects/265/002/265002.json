    "description": "Presented like fragments of an ancient sculpture, this set of bones was the right knee of Union Private Gardiner Lewis, who was wounded in the battle of Gettysburg by a round musket ball. It is specimen number 1956 in the collection of the Army Medical Museum. Established in 1862 by order of President Lincoln, the Army Medical Museum\u2014now the National Museum of Health and Medicine\u2014is one of the most important scientific legacies of the Civil War. Its primary mandate was the collection of specimens for research in military medicine and surgery. During and after the war, museum curators solicited contributions from Union doctors\u2014mostly in the form of photographs and patient histories such as those made by Reed Brockway Bontecou. The museum also employed its own photographers to record wounded soldiers, the effect of gunshot wounds and amputations, and its own growing collection of \u201cmorbid anatomy . . . together with projectiles and foreign bodies removed.\u201d",
