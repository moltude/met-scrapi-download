    "description": "Brassa\u00ef made his name as a chronicler of the night, with images that ranged from reflections on wet cobblestones to the denizens of bars and brothels. Like so many of his photographs, Introductions at Suzy\u2019s was not an impromptu scene caught by an undetected observer but rather a carefully constructed tableau meant to highlight the dynamic between buttoned-up bourgeois clients and Suzy\u2019s bevy of prostitutes, naked but for their bracelets and high heels. The \"client\" was actually Brassa\u00ef\u2019s friend and bodyguard; the \"girls,\" however, were not stand-ins.",
