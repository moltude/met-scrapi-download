This image appeared on the cover of Formes Nues (1935), which also included the work of Brassa\u00ef, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Franz Roh, and George Platt Lynes, among others. In the magazine\u2019s introduction, Man Ray wrote, \"were it not for the fact that photography permits me to seize and to possess the human body and face in more than a temporary manner, I should quickly have tired of this medium.\"",
