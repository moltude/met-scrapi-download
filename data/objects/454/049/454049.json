    "description": "This scene of leisure typifies the gracious style of later Mughal painting practiced at provincial centers such as Lucknow in the eighteenth century. Here, a prince and his consort smoke a huqqa, attended by ladies in the pleasant surroundings of a walled palace garden. Nidha Mal, a talented artist of the Delhi-based court of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah (r. 1719\u201348), later moved to Lucknow, where he continued to paint in the refined and naturalistic Delhi style.",
