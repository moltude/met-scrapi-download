    "description": "The \"Emperor\u2019s Album,\" to which this folio belongs, was made for Emperors Jahangir and Shah Jahan, and is considered one of the world\u2019s great assemblages of Mughal calligraphy and painting. On the recto, dervishes engage in the sufi ceremony known as the sama, where whirling and dancing is inspired by music and recitations of poetry. In their mystical dance, sufis achieve an ecstatic state, facilitating their connection to God. Here, enlightened and exhausted by their efforts, figures in the lower right and lower left swoon, and are supported by their companions. Each of the instruments used in the sama has a sacred meaning. The round shape of the large tambourine (daf) refers to the cycle of creation. The flute (nay) is a symbol for the human essence, and breath blown into the flute is akin to the divine light penetrating man\u2019s soul.The verso contains six diagonal lines of poetry in cartouches, surrounded by a scrolling floral motif.",
