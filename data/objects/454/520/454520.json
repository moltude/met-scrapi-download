    "description": "Geometric designs such as the ones in this fragment are found ornamenting a wide variety of media produced in Nasrid period (1232\u20131492) Spain, including tile work, woodwork, book binding, and painted stucco. The basic principles of this design include geometric and floral motifs, as well as the classic eight-pointed star, here enclosing a rosette, both of which are nested inside a scalloped medallion. Such bold designs recall the famous wall patterns in the Alhambra palace in Granada. In both the plaster and tile work of the buildings in the palace, interlacery designs are closely related to the star-forms in this weaving.",
