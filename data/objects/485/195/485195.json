Lindner's poem for the exhibition catalogue, \"Marilyn was Here!\" captures the incongruities of her short life (1926-1962): \"smiling breasts / public lips / special delivery / HOLLYWOOD / disconnected / patrolman's walk / sleepless nude / NIGHT ANGEL / black exit / purple peace / perhaps!\" In this collage, he portrays her as both sexual vixen and national icon.",
