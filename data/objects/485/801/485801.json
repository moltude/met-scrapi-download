    "description": "The husband-and-wife team known as Christo and Jeanne-Claude (born 1935) have collaborated on huge environmental art projects since 1961, when they installed Stacked Oil Barrels and Dockside Packages in the Cologne Harbor, Germany. Over the past forty-three years, they have completed more than forty wrapped and curtained pieces around the globe (including the United States, Germany, France, Australia, and Japan). In February 2005, The Gates: Project for Central Park, New York will consist of 7,500 metal and fabric \"gates\" placed along twenty-three miles of footpaths. Such works are usually monumental in scale-such as running a fabric curtain through northern California in 1976 or wrapping the Reichstag (the seat of the German Parliament) in Berlin in 1995-and require years of planning, but are designed to survive only a few hours to a few weeks. Their ephemeral beauty is captured in numerous preparatory drawings, photographs, and films.Not surprisingly, many of their projects go unrealized, which is the case for the work envisioned in this multimedia drawing. In preparatory drawings like this, which are sold to help fund the project, Christo provides a general overview of the site (in a reworked photograph and a map) and a detailed section of how the work will look in situ, with a sample of the fabric. As the inscription indicates, it is a design for a wrapped walkway in the Sonsbeek Park in Arnhem, the Netherlands, which was to have extended about 30,000 meters square and 6,440 meters in length-one of two walkway projects to have taken place simultaneously in 1971, the other in Ueno Park in Tokyo.",
