    "description": "During the 1920s and 1930s the skyscraper became a potent and uniquely American symbol of modernity: the ultimate attribute of success was a penthouse apartment in Manhattan. The jagged outline of the New York skyline was recognizable worldwide. It suggested strength, daring, faith in the future, and rejection of the constraints of the past. Artists and designers of the period, searching for a new vocabulary with which to express the excitement and optimism of the age, seized upon the image of the skyscraper and utilized it not only in paintings and sculpture but also in everything from furniture to fabrics.",
