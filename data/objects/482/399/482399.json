    "description": "Mailou Jones was awarded a fellowship in 1937 to study painting at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris.  There she produced some forty pictures in just nine months, one of which was Cauliflower and Pumpkin.  Her skill as a painter is evident, and reflects her recent study of the work of the French Post-Impressionist Paul C\u00e9zanne.  In this traditional still life arrangement of cabbage, gourd, potatoes, knife, and drapery, Jones achieves a poetic realism that transcends the mundaneness of her props.  With thick painterly strokes she \"sculpts\" the forms and space, using precise planes of color to suggest the smooth surfaces of the pumpkin and tabletop.",
