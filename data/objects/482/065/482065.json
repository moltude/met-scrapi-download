    "description": "Bhavsar was born in India, but came to New York in the 1960s, when the city had been firmly established as the capital of the art world. There he met and interacted with many artists, including the well-known Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. Rothko's spiritual, abstract paintings have had a long-term effect on Bhavsar, who has continued to make meditative pictures of floating fields of color such as this one for almost forty years.",
