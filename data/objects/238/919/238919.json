    "description": "The use of dressing-table sets made of bois de Sainte Lucie was stimulated by Louis XIV\u2019s sumptuary edicts of 1689 and 1709, which caused much French silver to be melted down. Named for the patron saint of the Lorraine region, this type of cherry or dense fruitwood from a forest near Nancy was appreciated for its reddish brown color and its pleasant smell reminiscent of cinnamon. It lent itself beautifully to carving, showing intricate patterns that resemble goldsmith work.",
