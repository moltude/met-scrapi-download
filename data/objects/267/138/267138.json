    "description": "From the moment of his first exhibition in 1988, at the age of twenty, Tillmans has been recognized as an artist of precocious talent. Conscripting magazines such as i-D, Interview, and Index as his exhibition space, he published provocative pictures of youth culture's rituals, self-image, and style that looked nothing like high fashion. Their exciting transgressions and seemingly casual snapshot style seemed, however, totally appropriate to describing the texture of a nomadic counterculture whose ethos is the elimination of all boundaries.",
