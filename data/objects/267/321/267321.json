    "description": "This nearly abstract view down the railroad tracks of a suspension bridge is both a dramatic celebration of the industrial age and an effective evocation of speed.  The tubular bridge, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was the most difficult and important structure built on the Great Western Railway which linked London and the West Country.  The 2,240 foot railroad bridge crosses the Tamar river and Hamoaze estuary in southeast Cornwall.",
