    "description": "From 1862 to 1881 Adolphe Terris photographed the massive changes in Marseille's urban fabric for the municipal and prefectural governments-a project comparable in scope and intention to Charles Marville's commissioned views of Paris during the same period.  His first series (from which this picture is taken) was produced to preserve the memory and appearance of the old quarters of Marseilles before they disappeared forever.  In this view, Terris leads the eye up a hilly street drenched in midday sun towards a street lamp jutting out from a building at the peak of the road, as if signaling the way toward the town's impending modernity.",
