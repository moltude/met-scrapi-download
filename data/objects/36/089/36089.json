    "description": "This leaf is dated to the ninth lunar month of 1654, when Zhou Lianggong was transferred from his official post in Fujian Province to Beijing. En route Zhou passed through Suzhou and Nanjing, and it seems likely that he had the opportunity to solicit a painting from Xiang, a prominent Ming loyalist artist, at that time. A contemporary admirer, Wu Guodui, then added this poem:Master Wu saw this and admired it:Bright sky and thick frost mark autumn's coming;The mountains have turned purple, the trees red.Cold crows caw in the evening breeze,But in the growing dusk there is no one to point out the road.",
