During the Han dynasty, luxury goods and tombs furnishings made of wood or bamboo (or some other material) were coated and decorated with colored lacquers. Basins similar in shape and ornamentation to this example have been excavated at several sites in China suggesting that it was used for a liquid such as wine or soup.",
