Many of these objects were made by artists trained in the Mosul tradition and share characteristics with Jaziran works, such as the use of the T\u2011fret background and the Z\u2011shaped whorl motif. An emphasis on princely imagery, is demonstrated by the formal enthronement scenes depicted here. The inclusion of gold as an inlay material is thought to indicate Damascus manufacture.",
