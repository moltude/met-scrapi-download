A wick produced from plant fiber or linen fabric was placed in a reservoir filled with oil, generally castor or sesame oil, and illuminated. The disc of this red earthenware lamp depicts the bust of a woman in a medallion formed by a palm; the image is surrounded by a broad rim decorated with ornamental squares, concentric circles, and palmettes.",
