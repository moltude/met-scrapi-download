Situated within forty miles of the Ottoman capital city of Istanbul, the ceramic workshops of Iznik began producing ceramic tiles for the Ottoman court in the early part of the sixteenth century. An explosion of Iznik tile production occurred in the mid\u2011sixteenth century, stimulated by a surge of royal building in Istanbul supervised by the celebrated Ottoman architect\u2011in\u2011chief, Sinan. Colorful, repeating-pattern Iznik tiles such as these still enliven the walls of mosques and palaces  throughout Istanbul.",
