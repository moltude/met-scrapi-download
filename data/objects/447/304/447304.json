    "description": "This painting and the two next to it come from the same copy of a highly Persianate Shahnama that was probably made in northern India. The paintings from this book were later placed in an album with brightly colored borders. The illustration may represent two figures of the Sasanian period, Hurmuzd (r. 579\u201390) and his son Khusrau (r. 590\u2013628). Although here Khusrau makes a humble appearance at his father\u2019s court, he later executed Hurmuzd and took the throne.5-",
