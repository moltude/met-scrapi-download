Coptic, the latest stage of the Egyptian language, is written with the Greek alphabet, supplemented by seven additional signs. The Arabic text to the right side of each page was for the use of those who no longer easily read Coptic. Crosses worked in interlaced geometric patterns often appear in Coptic manuscripts.",
