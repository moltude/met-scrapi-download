    "description": "This bowl belongs to a group known as Garrus ware, named after a district southwest of the Caspian Sea, where examples were reportedly found. They epitomize two of the most typical Garrus ware designs: vegetal motifs within interlaced frameworks, and animals in heraldic poses.  The designs are carved through the creamy slip coating the body, exposing the reddish earthenware, to which darkening agents are applied. Finally the whole piece is covered with the transparent glaze.",
