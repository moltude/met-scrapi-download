    "description": "Safavid textiles produced during the seventeenth century were popular commodities in both international and local markets. Popular designs included bird and flower motifs, like those seen here, and weavers often favored luxurious materials like silk and metal-wrapped thread. The apricot orange and light green seen here indicate a preference for a soft color palette, and the overall shape suggests that it may have been used as a chasuble, a sleeveless Christian vestment.",
