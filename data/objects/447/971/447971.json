    "description": "The decoration on this textile fragment consists of circular medallions with images of addorsed quadrupeds standing on their hind legs. The void between the animals\u2019 bodies contains a plant-like form, suggesting the tree of life. Alternating with the medallions, a row of eight-pointed starts is depicted- a traditional Spanish motif. Depictions of animal forms within framing devices were also common decorative motifs in objects produced around the Mediterranean in the medieval period, and can be found ornamenting wood, textiles, ivory, metalwork and ceramics.",
