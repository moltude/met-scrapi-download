    "description": "Much of the art of central and northern Vanuatu in thesouthwest Pacific is associated with grade rituals, ahierarchical series of initiations, each of which conferssuccessively greater religious and political authority duringlife and in the realm of the dead. In some areas, individualswho have reached the highest grades are considered theliving dead, having already achieved the status of ancestors.Men\u2019s and women\u2019s grade rituals exist in most areas, butsculpture is created almost exclusively for men\u2019s grade rites.This figure is carved from fern wood, the fibrous trunk ofa tree fern composed of aerial roots surrounding a woodycore. During the grade rites, grade figures are erected onthe dancing ground and serve as temporary abode for thespirits associated with the grade. After the ceremony, thefigure, its purpose served, is left on the dancing ground,its supernatural powers waning as it slowly disintegrates.Collected soon after it was used, this particular figureretains portions of its original paint.",
