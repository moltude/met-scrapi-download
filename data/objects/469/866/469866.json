    "description": "Saint Anthony Abbot's test of faith at the hands of a clutch of demons is represented here in a charming, if somewhat naive, Late Gothic style. Dressed as an abbot, the saint holds a crosier, which terminates in a tau cross and a mendicant's bell; he is surrounded by fantastical beasts. The inscription suggests that the roundel was a donation by a local priest, who kneels before the saint next to his coat of arms.This roundel is stylistically consistent with other works known to have originated in southern Germany. The inscription names the village of Kappel and its priest in 1532.",
