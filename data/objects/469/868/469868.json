    "description": "By the beginning of the fifteenth century glass was increasingly the material of choice for drinking vessels, replacing cruder ones of wood and earthenware and sometimes more expensive metal ones. Surviving glass vessels, as well as representations of them in manuscript illuminations, prints, and panel paintings, indicate that glass forms grew more and more sophisticated about 1500. In this especially well-preserved example, the body of the beaker, with its prunted decoration (the applied \"blobs\" of glass), is surmounted by a wide, flaring lip that has been textured in a mold. The vessel's green color derives from the iron content of river sand, which was the primary ingredient for glass. Northern European forests provided ample supplies of fuel and ash, also required for glassmaking.",
