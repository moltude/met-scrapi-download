Although not of royal lineage, as in-laws of the king, Yuya and his wife Tjuyu were given a sumptuous burial in the royal cemetery now known as the Valley of the Kings. The tomb (KV 46) was discovered in 1905 by an American, Theodore M. Davis, who was allowed to keep a few of the finds, the majority of which are in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.Three shabtis (30.8.56\u2013.58), also inscribed for Yuya, are also in the Museum's collection.",
