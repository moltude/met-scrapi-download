    "description": "This slender, elegant bottle, with its flaring rim in the form of an open papyrus umbel, was among the cache of objects discovered in a pit (KV 54) in the valley of the Kings in 1907.  The objects are associated with the funeral of Tutankhamun, whose tomb was discovered some fifteen years later about 100 meters away.  The decoration around the neck imitates floral collars made of leaves, petals, flower buds, and berries that were worn by banquet guests and draped around vessels used at banquets.  Several such collars were also found in the cache (see 09.184.214).  This bottle may have been used in the purification ritual at Tutankhamun's burial or to serve a spiced beverage at his funeral banquet.Other objects from Tutankhamun's funeral cache are displayed in gallery 122.",
