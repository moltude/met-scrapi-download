    "description": "As was customary during the New Kingdom, these offering-bearerswear kilts over their calf-length tunics. To make a tunic a rectangular piece oflinen was folded in half and sewn together along its sides up toabout one foot from the top (to allow for armholes). Because thegarment was generally wider than the wearer, extra material hungover each shoulder somewhat like a sleeve; the slack materialbeneath the arm created a flaplike \u201cwing,\u201d thus ruling out thepresence of actual sleeves. At the time this wall painting wasmade, it was not yet fashionable for shoulder flaps to be pleated.",
