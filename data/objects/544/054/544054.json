    "description": "This spherical object represents a hedgehog tightly curled in self-defence. The head, feet, and tail are shown in relief. The animal's spines are indicated by black dots. The eyes and the rims of the large ears are also highlighted in black. Before firing, two holes were pierced through the surface at equal distances above and below the relief, but not quite on the axis of the sphere. The holes were probably made simultaneously by one instrument as they are exactly aligned. The hollow ball was most likely formed in two halves, as suggested by the hairline crack along part of the circumference.",
