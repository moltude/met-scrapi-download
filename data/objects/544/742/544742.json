    "description": "The Royal Scribe and Overseer of the Granaries, Siase, dedicated this statue which represents Isis, his patron goddess, and Wepwawet, the local god of Assiut where the statue was made.  Its fine but rather provincial style is the work of sculptors who were somewhat removed from the mainstream of the royal workshops.  However, many of their mannerisms, such as the round cheeks and pronounced blandness of the goddess' face, gained popularity during the succeeding century.  The inscriptons on the front of the statue contain prayers to the two gods. On the back is a long prayer to Osiris, invoking his aid in the Hereafter.",
