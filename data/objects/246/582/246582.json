    "description": "Obverse and reverse, between eyes, nose; at handles, earsWhile certainly influenced by Attic models, Chalcidian eye-cups have a distinct elegance produced by their normally  fine potting and and precise decoration. The small, concave foot that is often reserved rather than glazed also gives these works a light appearance. While noses do occur between eyes on Attic eye-cups, the inclusion of ears is a Chalcidian feature. The noses and ears evoke satyrs and associate the decoration, sparse though it is, with the world of Dionysos.",
