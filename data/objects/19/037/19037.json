        "Estate of Marie Zimmermann, until 1972Ms. Ida Egli, Marie Zimmermann's caretaker and companionThe box is among thirty objects from the Estate of Marie Zimmermann and consigned by Ms. Ida Egli. Egli and Zimmermann became friends when Zimmermann would dine at Egli's restaurant, The Chalet Suisse, in New York City. Egli eventually moved in with Zimmermann to manage her household. When Zimmermann retired to Florida, Egli followed and chose approximately thirty objects to accompany them in their Florida house. When Zimmermann died in 1972, she left the objects to Egli, in whose collection they have been ever since. When Egli's family recently moved her to smaller quarters, they consigned the collection for sale."
