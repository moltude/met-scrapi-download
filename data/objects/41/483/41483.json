He wrote: \u201cNowadays when people paint they do only what appeals to the common eye; I alone do not seek to please the present.\u201d In this album, both paintings and inscriptions attest to Gong\u2019s striving after a spiritual communion with earlier masters while creating a pictorial vocabulary all his own. Departing from his densely textured, monumental landscape style of the 1660s, Gong moved toward a sparser manner in which each brushstroke is made to function calligraphically as well as descriptively, embodying both expressive and representational meaning.  The album\u2019s format\u2014paintings accompanied by art-historical comments\u2014reminds us that Gong Xian taught painting for a living.",
