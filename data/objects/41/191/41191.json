    "description": "The plum, the first flower to appear in spring, is celebrated along with bamboo and pine as one of the Three Friends of Winter. Admired for its purity and hardiness, sending forth new shoots and delicate blossoms from seemingly lifeless branches, the plum became a symbol of survival, rejuvenation, and longevity. Here, the tight clusters of pale blossoms and buds indicate that the plum has just begun to flower.In this work by the otherwise unknown Chinese Buddhist monk Ni Jing, both composition and brushwork derive from the renowned Yuan-dynasty plum painter Wang Mian (d. 1359). The artist has calligraphed a poetic inscription in a highly animated cursive script, in places letting the brush go almost dry before reinking. The poem reads:Blossoms rival the moonin brightness,Hundreds of them overlappinglike fragrant snowflakes.Since men of the world vieby preening in fine colors,Do not scoop up waterto wash away badges of pink.\u300c\u83ef\u5bb9\u6708\u8272\u591a\u722d\u5149\uff0c\u4e00\u767d\u6e3e\u7591\u96ea\u6709\u9999\u3002\u4eba\u4e16\u7af6\u8a87\u984f\u8272\u597d\uff0c\u83ab\u6559\u63ac\u6c34\u6d17\u7d05\u599d\u3002\u5357\u838a\u924f\u53df\u5beb\u300dWritten by Nanzhuang Chusou [Ni Jing]\u2014Trans.
