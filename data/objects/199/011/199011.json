The portraits represent the donor, Georges d\u2019Amboise (1460\u20131510), in his cardinal\u2019s hat and cloak and Louis XII (1462\u20131515; ruled 1498\u20131515) surrounded by a wreath topped by a porcupine, a symbol of the monarch\u2019s courage and ability to defend his kingdom. These panels and the ones displayed nearby are from the now-destroyed chapel of Cardinal d\u2019Amboise\u2019s ch\u00e2teau de Gaillon.",
