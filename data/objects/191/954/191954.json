    "description": "The seaweed marquetry in oval reserves is bookmatched. The simultaneous sawing of bundled veneers meant that four sheets of veneer were cut together, two for the background and two for the ornamentation. Half of these were then turned over, just like the pages of a book, and adhered to the deal substrate side by side so that a strictly symmetrical decoration was achieved with a joint in the middle. The bracket feet are later and may replace original bun feet.",
