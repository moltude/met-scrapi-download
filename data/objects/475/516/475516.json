    "description": "This ensemble (acc. nos. 47.101.26\u2013.28) contains all the elements needed for the celebration of the Mass: the paten for the bread, the chalice to hold the wine, and a straw to sip it. Straws were used to prevent spilling the wine, which was believed to be the actual blood of Christ. Most often used in pairs, straws became particularly popular in the thirteenth century. The decoration of this chalice and paten juxtaposes scenes from the life of Christ with Old Testament events interpreted to prefigure them. The apostles encircle the bowl of the chalice, while the representation of St. Trudpert on the paten provides the key to the original ownership of this liturgical set.",
