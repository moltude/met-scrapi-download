    "description": "At center is Shadakshari Lokesvara, a four-armed form of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. His primary hands are pressed together in the gesture of veneration (anjali mudra); his right hand holds a mala and his left hand holds a lotus and a book. He sits in a yogic posture, legs crossed, drawing legitimacy from ascetic practice as a means to harness the power of meditation. This deity is a manifestation of Avalokitesvara, a bodhisattva of our era who embodies compassion and protection and helps clear a path to enlightenment for the devotee.",
