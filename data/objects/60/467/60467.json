    "description": "Mus\u014d Soseki, the expert calligrapher of this verse, was one of the most influential Zen priests of the fourteenth century, having trained under the Chinese \u00e9migr\u00e9 Yishan Yining (Japanese: Issan Ichinei; 1247\u20131317). He received the special imperial designation \u201cNational Master Mus\u014d.\u201d As a rule, Mus\u014d \u2019s calligraphic works are executed in an elegant cursive script, reflecting the influence of his Chinese master. The highly stylized characters in this piece suggest that Mus\u014d had carefully studied classical examples. The verse reads:From heaven fall icy petals;In the sky not a spot of blue remains.A dusting of jade covers the groundAnd buries the blue mountains.The sun rises over the mountain peak.The chill pierces my bones.Silence prevails.\u2014Trans.
