    "description": "Although often found in porcelain, the shape of this vase is unusual in Chinese carved lacquer, and its use in this medium reflects the experimentation and sharing of imagery that characterized the eighteenth century. Unlike most carved lacquers, which have a wood substructure, the weight of this vase suggests that it was formed using a metal such as copper. Four cartouches decorated with scenes of figures in landscapes are set against the lush peony scrolls that fill the background.",
