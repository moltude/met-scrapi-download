    "description": "This traditionally mounted tangka depicting Raktayamari (Red Yamari) in union with his consort, an emanation of himself, is a masterpiece in its complexity and exquisitely realized detail. He and his consort trample his enemy Yama, the god of death, who is outstretched on a red bull. He holds a staff and a skull cup. Radiating from the central square are four differently colored manifestations of Yamari, also depicted in yab-yum (sexual union).The precision, strong colors, and animated line work suggest the hand of a master painter. An inscription identifies the work as a meditation tangka belonging to Kunga Lekpa, one of the teachers of the great Tibetan theologian Tsong Khapa (1357\u20131419). This confirms a date in the late fourteenth century, when the master of this time, Mikyo Dorje, is known to have been active. The tangka is one of the few Tibetan paintings datable to the period and is therefore significant for understanding the chronological developments of regional schools in Tibet. In the bottom register at the left is the officiating monk, possibly Kunga Lekpa himself.",
