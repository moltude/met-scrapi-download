Presenting modern machines and weapons as fantastic beasts, each image bears a title with the creature\u2019s name\u2014a thinly veiled phonetic equivalent of its name in English\u2014and an enumeration of its salient characteristics. Qiu\u2019s designs also appeared in his 2006 video of the same title.",
