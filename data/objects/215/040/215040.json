    "description": "Punto in aria\u2014literally, \"stitches in the air\"\u2014is one of the earliest styles of needle lace, which is itself developed from cutwork of primarily geometric design. When lacemakers transitioned to using a foundation of threads laid out according to a pattern drawn on parchment, they were able to incorporate more fluid lines and curves into their designs. The potential of the technique is well illustrated by this piece, the center of a chalice veil, which depicts a saint, possibly Augustine, holding a bishop\u2019s crozier. The facial features, costume details, and hands are delineated by corded and buttonholed threads.",
