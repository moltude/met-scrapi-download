    "description": "The peacock insignia was worn by Qing-dynasty civil officials of the third rank. Originally, this sumptuous badge appears to have had a split down the center, suggesting that it was for the front of an official's surcoat, which would have opened down the middle. Rank badges for the back of the surcoat have no such split.Fittingly, peacock-feather thread, now very worn, was used in the embroidery of the peacock's tail and also for the perforated rock in the waves below.",
