    "description": "Picasso drew this portrait of the French Symbolist poet Paul Verlaine (1844-1896), and another of his friend St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (1842-1898), on the endpapers to an edition of Mallarm\u00e9's poetry that belonged to his friend Paul \u00c9luard (1895-1952). The Metropolitan's drawing was separated from both the book and its companion drawing at some point before 1966.Picasso was probably introduced to Verlaine's poetry while still a teenager in Spain, but it was Max Jacob, whom he met in Paris in the summer of 1901, who was responsible for the artist's early education in French literature, especially Verlaine. Picasso met \u00c9luard in the mid-1920s through his associations with the Surrealists. He dedicated a number of poems to Picasso and collected his work. In turn, Picasso contributed original illustrations to \u00c9luard's publications.",
