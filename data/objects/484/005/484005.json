    "description": "Reindl, a student at the Bauhaus, probably made this group of tiny collages as an exercise in abstract design. The school's academic staff, which included the painter Paul Klee, who taught an influential elemental design theory class, argued that that beauty need not depend on ornament but could be achieved through the manipulation of form and the judicious use of color and texture. These collages, with their juxtapositions of varicolored geometric shapes, exhibit the simplicity, aesthetic economy, and wit that are the hallmarks of the best Bauhaus design.",
