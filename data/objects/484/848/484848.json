    "description": "Olga de Amaral is one of the leading artists of the post-World War II studio craft movement. Her \"woven walls\" are deeply personal, suffused with the essence of her native Colombia. She subtly incorporates the landscape, the architecture of old houses with adobe walls and tile roofs, and golden Baroque churches as abstract patterns in the rich surface of her tapestries.",
