    "description": "On March 16, 1856, Empress Eug\u00e9nie gave birth to a male heir, Napol\u00e9on Eug\u00e8ne, known as the prince imperial, thus ensuring the continuation of the imperial bloodline. At a series of events that autumn at the palace of Compi\u00e8gne, the prince imperial was presented to members of the court. Olympe Aguado, a talented amateur photographer and founding member of the French Photographic Society, was among the aristocratic guests invited from October 27 to November 2 and was enlisted as the unofficial recorder of the event.The hope for a dynasty would, however, not be fulfilled. Napoleon III died in exile in 1873, and the prince imperial-despite being proclaimed Napoleon IV by Bonapartists-never ruled. The only child of Napoleon and Eug\u00e9nie died at the age of twenty-three, fighting for the British in the Zulu Wars.",
