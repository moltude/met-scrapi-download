    "description": "Graham made this photograph of a roadside diner three years after his landmark photo-essay \"Homes for America\" appeared in Arts magazine (December 1966). In that piece, the artist related the serial, repetitive patterns and primary structures of Minimalism to the postwar tract housing of Levittown, New York, and Fairlawn and Jersey City, New Jersey-architectural emblems of the suburban alienation and social anomie described in magazines like Esquire and sung about acidly by groups like the Beatles and the Kinks. Dated \"69\" in reverse on the restaurant's advertisement for chicken dinner, Graham's photograph also drops an ironic dose of late 1960s mysticism on the Establishment in the yin-yang symbol seen when inside looking out.",
