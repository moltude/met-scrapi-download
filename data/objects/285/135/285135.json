    "description": "Bing moved to Paris in 1930 and soon became known as the \u201cQueen of the Leica\u201d for her expertise at exploiting the hand-held 35mm camera\u2019s ability to capture and transmit action. Here she responds to the odd, spectral beauty of the light emitted by a common gas lamp. In 1828 Paris became one of the first European cities to adopt gas street lighting, resurrecting its nickname \u201cLa Vielle-Lumi\u00e8re,\u201d or \u201cCity of Light.\u201d The sobriquet was first applied to Paris during the Age of Enlightment in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries due to its fame as a center of education and ideas.",
