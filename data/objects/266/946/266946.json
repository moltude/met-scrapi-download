    "description": "Trained in traditional Korean calligraphy and ceramics, Lee imbues her photographs with a delicate handcrafted quality and a palpable sense of the texture and physicality of the print surface. Rather than using commercially produced photographic paper, she prints her negatives on large sheets of handmade rice paper, which she brushes with liquid photosensitive emulsion. The subtle variations in print texture and contrast are balanced by the understated simplicity of Lee's images. This photograph of the worn sole of an old tennis shoe was made on one of her many road trips across the American desert.",
