    "description": "Born into an aristocratic family in Jaipur, India, Singh lived and worked in Paris, London, and New York, but his lifelong subject as a photographer was the vibrant culture and landscape of modern India. With its emphasis on visual surprise and spontaneity, Singh's work belongs to the tradition of small-format street photography pioneered by such artists as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank. Unlike many of his European counterparts, however, Singh worked exclusively in color, often composing his images with a graphic complexity akin to that of Mughal miniatures. In this view of a busy intersection through a plate-glass window, the artist vividly captures the surging energy and functional mayhem of Bombay, India's Mayanagri, or City of Wealth. Singh's prolific career was cut short when he died this year at the age of fifty-eight.",
