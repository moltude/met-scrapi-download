    "description": "The main decoration of this iridescent glass bottle is made of horizontal rows of hexagons, in a \"honeycomb\" pattern. This faceted effect was created by slicing off portions of the surface from the original spherical shape. This pattern was well known in Iran and Mesopotamia in the Sasanian era and was revived by the glass-cutters of the early Islamic period. .",
