    "description": "Ibrahim 'Adil Shah II (r. 1580\u20131627) was the sixth ruler of Bijapur, a kingdom in the Deccan region of India. It has been argued that the artist Hashim, who painted this likeness, joined the Mughal imperial atelier around 1620, after serving in the Deccan. Whereas the strong contours, costume details, and palette are considered to be vestiges of Hashim\u2019s Deccani origins, his thoroughly Mughal rendering of facial features is attributed to changes made under Jahangir\u2019s guidance.",
