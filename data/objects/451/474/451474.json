    "description": "Traditional ceramic production in Syria continued after the region came under Ottoman control in the early sixteenth century. Syrian tiles and ceramics of this period are related to Iznik wares, but do not include red in their palette. This large inscription panel was created in Syria for an unidentified mosque. Its calligraphy reads: \"The weak servant Kayun ibn 'Abdallah, the sinful, the one in need of God\u2019s mercy, founded this blessed mosque. It was built in the year 1000 [A.H./A.D. 1591\u201392].\" Further examples of Syrian tilework panels flank the entrance to the adjoining gallery.",
