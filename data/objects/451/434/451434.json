    "description": "In one group of ceramics, potters combined the technique of mina'i painting with decoration in low relief, which is further highlighted by gilding, to create an even more sumptuous effect. The imagery on this bottle conveys the princely themes so characteristic of the Seljuq period: enthroned rulers, seated sphinxes, and entertainers, against raised and gilded patterns of foliate and zigzag designs. A band with a Persian inscription, also raised and gilded, divides the shoulder from the body.",
