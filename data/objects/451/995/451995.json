    "description": "Muslim potters working in the lusterware industry emigrated to the region of Valencia in the early 14th century, and these craftsmen established and dominated the Manises ceramic industry for the next hundred years. Lusterware was the most significant luxury ceramic for both local consumption and international export. The prestige of these wares is evidenced by the decorative heraldic blazons belonging to a number of noble, ecclesiastical, and royal patrons. This dish is ornamented with an eagle blazon of an unidentified patron.In the late 15th century a shift in the taste led to the production of this type of dish, called \"gadrooned ware.\" Characterized by the raised and tapered gadroon decoration around the outer rim and inner raised boss, this design was borrowed from contemporary metalwork, which often comprised raised decorative elements.",
