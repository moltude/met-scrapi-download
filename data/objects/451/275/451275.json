    "description": "These portraits were made for Jahangir (r. 1605\u201327), whose painters, while technically flawless, were able to reveal the nuances of characterization. 'Inayat   Khan, a favorite courtier, is remembered today from two portraits made as he lay at death\u2019s door, emaciated from his addiction to opium and wine, though here he appears healthy. 'Abd al-Khaliq met his death after siding with Shah Jahan against his father. Jamal Khan Qaravul was a minor nobleman, and the identification of the raja, in Jahangir\u2019s handwriting, is illegible.",
