    "description": "Foreign travelers from as early as Marco Polo knew of the quality of the embroidery produced in Gujarat, a state on India\u2019s northwestern coast, and as soon as European trade with India picked up in the early 1600s, embroidered Gujarati textiles were identified as among the most lucrative goods for export. This fragment from a hanging is one of the earliest examples of this overseas commerce, and comes from the Ashburnham House in Sussex, England. Embroideries like this were probably made at different centers throughout Gujarat, but are usually associated with Cambay, the port from which they were exported.",
