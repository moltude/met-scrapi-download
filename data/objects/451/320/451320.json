    "description": "The style and subject of this work are emblematic of the master painter Riza, who is best known for his paintings of languorous youths. The curving body of the young man, his delicately painted curls, and the garden setting are all typical of Riza\u2019s work in the early seventeenth century. His style and subjects reflect the taste of Shah 'Abbas\u2019 court at Isfahan, which was renowned for its luxurious palaces and gardens, and attracted visitors from all over the world. The painting is signed below the figure and to the right of the fruit: \"Riza drew it.\"",
