    "description": "This head ornament and objects 65.265.2, 65.265.6, and 65.265.7  are related in technique and design to pieces made in Istanbul, and thus may be considered representative of the western reaches of Ottoman style. Although Morocco was never part of the Ottoman empire, these head ornaments illustrate the degree to which the Ottoman style penetrated surrounding regions.The ornaments with the pendant elements were hooked, near the top of the head, to a headdress; from these were suspended by chains the larger circular elements, the most decorative parts of which were seen from the front, at approximately ear level",
