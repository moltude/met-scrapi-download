    "description": "During the Ilkhanid period, a series of magnificent, large\u2011scale Qur'an manuscripts were produced. While few can be directly linked to royal patronage, the size and quality of their paper, along with their splendid calligraphy and illumination, suggest they were produced for members of the Ilkhanid court. This folio from the \"Anonymous Baghdad Qur'an\" (so called due to  its unknown patron) provides not only its date and place of production, but also the name of its masterful calligrapher and illuminator.",
