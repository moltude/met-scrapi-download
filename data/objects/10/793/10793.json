    "description": "Inspired by William Cullen Bryant's poem \"Thanatopsis,\" this landscape  was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1850. The  catalogue noted lines from Bryant's poem. After the exhibition, the  picture was acquired by the American Art-Union and distributed in the  same year to one of its subscribers. Durand's son noted that after  this his father got the picture back, repainted parts of it, and sold  it to Mr. B.F. Gardner. Durand briefly resumed painting large  philosophical landscapes after the death of Thomas Cole, using his  works as models. The presence of a funeral, of a farmer's daily work,  and of the ruins of man in ancient nature reflects the poem's emphasis  on the permanence of the earth and the creation and reversion of man  from and to its soils.",
