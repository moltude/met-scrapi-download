    "description": "Two disc valves. Disc valves are more airtight than swivel valves, with enhanced mechanical performance.Disc-valve trumpets were England's most visible contribution to the history of valve instruments. They were manufactured between about 1840 and 1860 solely by John Augustus K\u00f6hler in London. The three instruments on display cover the entire evolution of the type, from those with swivel valves to those with disc valves with piston action.",
