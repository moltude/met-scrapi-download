    "description": "This wooden ceiling panel probably came from a palace or villa in Granada, originally part of a long ceiling covering a patio. The type, referred to in Spanish as artesonado, is well represented among the ceilings still in situ at the Alhambra\u2014for example, the one that covers the porch of the Torre de las Damas. The geometric design, based on a star-and-polygon pattern and articulated by four muqarnas lanterns, would originally have been richly pigmented and highlighted with gilding.",
