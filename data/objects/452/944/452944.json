    "description": "While the style of illumination and use of  muhaqqaq script point to a fourteenth century date for this Qur\u2019an, the place where it was copied is uncertain. The size of the manuscript, the type of paper it is written on and the appearance of Persian translations underneath each line of Arabic are typical of Qur\u2019ans from both India and Iran during this period.The folio has seven lines with interlinear Persian translation in naskhi script. This folio with verses 81-86 from Surah al-A\u2019raf (chapter 7) has an ornamental medallion on the margin of the recto marking the tenth verse.",
