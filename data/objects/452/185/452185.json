    "description": "In the year 630, during a fifty-day reign, Shah Farain Guraz completely dissipated the entire royal treasury. Because of this greed and injustice, the army soon turned against the shah and swore to rid Iran of the usurper. One day while on a hunt, the leader of the coup, Shahran Guraz, drew his bow as if to shoot a stag but instead shot the monarch in the back. The accompanying warriors then began to battle with each other. This illustration appears to take place after the murder of the shah. Unlike many battle scenes, the artist Dust Muhammad has rendered each horse\u2019s armor with great care, resulting in a rhythmic and colorful pattern across the field of the painting",
