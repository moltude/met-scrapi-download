    "description": "Yastiks are cushion covers used by the Ottoman elite to decorate the interiors of their palaces. They are distinguished by their rectangular shape, a dominant red velvet background, and a composition framed on both sides with a band formed of a linear repeating motif. These cushion covers were produced in quantity; the same pattern type was woven one after the other in a continuous length on the loom and later cut to size.",
