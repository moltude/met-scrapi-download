By the time he was old enough to participate in a series of assemblies of wise men, such as the scene here, Nushirvan depended on Buzurgmihr more than any other counselor. Here, Muzaffar 'Ali, a versatile painter from the younger generation at the court workshop, has chosen a traditional composition, with the throne dominating the center and the figures symmetrically arranged.",
