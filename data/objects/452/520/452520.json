    "description": "Chess originated in India and has been popular in Islamic world for centuries. This ivory chess piece from the eighteenth century is a pawn in the form of a woman. The figure\u2019s round skirt, decorated with gold leaf and small piercings, forms a steady base for the piece. A long braid hangs down from the back of her head. Because the entire surface is covered with paint, gilding, and lacquer, the piece was once thought to have been made of wood rather than ivory.",
