    "description": "Inscribed textiles are called tiraz, from the Persian word for \"embroidery.\" Many were produced in royal workshops and presented by rulers to honor courtiers and officials at formal ceremonies. Their inscriptions name and bless the current ruler or caliph\u2014a reminder to the recipient that he owed his allegiance to that ruler. This tapestry-woven textile reflects a synthesis of styles common in early Islamic art. The abstract figural motifs in the horizontal band recall Late Antique prototypes. The pattern of alternating roundels and registers was widely used by Sasanian weavers. Above the horizontal band, the remaining fragments include an inscription in kufic script that suggests the textile may have functioned as a sleeve-band.",
