    "description": "This tile belongs to a unique group of monochrome glazed, molded relief tiles excavated from a palace at Ghazni, in modern Afghanistan. The decoration on this group consists of animals in heraldic poses (as seen here), as well as vegetal scrolls and calligraphy, often surrounded by beaded borders. The excavation stratigraphy dates them to the early thirteenth century, the period of the city\u2019s Ghurid rule. They were probably manufactured in Ghazni especially for the palace.",
