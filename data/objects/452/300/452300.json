    "description": "At first glance this textile\u2019s colorful palette, central mirrored design, and floriated medallion frame seem to recall Byzantine imperial silks. Yet this fragment is made entirely in wool, woven in a \"tapestry weave\", in which repeating patterns must be added into the textile\u2019s structure, and are not the result of the loom itself. The medallion frames a scene of two facing lions around a vase, from which emerges a composite floral form reminiscent of Sasanian winged motifs. Both the iconography and method of manufacture place this piece in the transitional period of the earliest Islamic centuries.",
