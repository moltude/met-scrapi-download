    "description": "This object represents a type of zoomorphic incense burner, many  of which have survived. The square opening in the chest once held a drawer for the placement of incense whose aroma would escape through the perforated areas. The falcon's head represents the upper section of a full bird's figure that was once hinged to the rest of the body.",
