    "description": "The largest carpets created by Turkmen nomadic weavers, known as \"main\" carpets, were used on the floors of Turkmen tent dwellings. They usually employed a series of small repeating medallions, known as gul, that varied in form according to the tribe of the weaver. Rare and of unusual beauty, and often incorporating a small amount of magenta silk pile in their designs, Salor main carpets such as this appear to be the archetypes from which other Turkmen tribes derived their own characteristic main carpets.",
