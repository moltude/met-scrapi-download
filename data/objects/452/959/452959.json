    "description": "Like so many ceramics produced in Iran during the Safavid period, the style and decoration of this dish was an attempt to emulate the highly-regarded Chinese porcelain wares. This is illustrated by the blue and white color scheme, as well the floral motifs. Pseudo-Chinese calligraphy has been painted on the reverse of the plate, a detail which illustrates the great lengths to which artists went to make their wares comparable to Chinese originals.",
