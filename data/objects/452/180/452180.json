    "description": "In negotiations between Iran and India concerning the payment of tribute to Iran, the king of India sent a challenge to the shah. If the shah could figure out the rules of the game that we know as chess from the board and pieces that he sent with his envoy, India would pay the tribute. If the shah failed, Iran would have to pay tribute to India. The wise Buzurjmihr was summoned and, after a day and night, announced that he had mastered the game; he then proceeded to show his skill against the Indian envoy. The light palette and arabesque and cloud-band patterns on the carpets suggest the influence of Shiraz-school painting.",
