    "description": "A professional printer as well as a photographer, Wyse makes technically assured yet enigmatically reticent images showing traces of past life or activity. The title of the series, Marks of Indifference, refers to an essay on photography and Conceptual Art by the artist Jeff Wall and is used by Wyse to denote the idea of the camera as a dispassionate recording device as well as the larger question of how artists' conscious and unconscious intentions manifest themselves in photographs. The \"indifference\" of the title also applies to the subjects of the pictures themselves: a car with a large dent in its side, a roadsign surrounded by overgrown foliage, the marks left by shelves torn from a wall. In this photograph of a squirrel left for dead on a paved suburban street, the large scale, sharp focus, and unusual worm's-eye view combine to give the picture a powerful dreamlike intensity.",
