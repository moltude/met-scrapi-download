    "description": "One genre of Company School painting served to record the wealth of the British in India, and their homes and furniture\u2013as in this painting\u2013were among the primary subjects. This painting also documents the unusual British practice of turning older buildings such as tombs or baths (as the title indicates) into residences. In this instance, the original structure is a domed octagonal chamber with an oculus. The dome itself has been decorated with a diaper-pattern grid. The walls below are articulated with recessed arches and a marble dado inlaid with red and green floral designs. The stone floor has been decorated in a grid pattern with central rosettes and a central inset that resembles a rug. To this basic structure the new owners have added a piano and bench in front of the window. In a niche in the arch behind the piano is a collection of their glass and stone objects.",
