    "description": "This silk textile shows pairs of confronting lions on either side of a stylized tree, enclosed by swooping crimson-colored split palmette leaves and set against a green ground. The lions have been compared to a Granadine textile bearing Nasrid heraldic emblems and rampant lions, which possibly served as the model. Variants of this pattern, depicting different slightly plant forms or animals suggest that these textiles were mass-produced. For similar textiles in the museum\u2019s collection, see also 11.23, 25.120.453, and 20.94.1.",
