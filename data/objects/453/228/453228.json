    "description": "This child's coat is tailored in late nineteenth-century style, but the fabric was probably woven earlier, in the late eighteenth century. This kind of textile is unique to Kashmir, where for decades families in the trade had spun, dyed, designed, and woven textiles for the emperors. A number of inscribed textiles of similar patterning and construction are known to have been made in Amritsar, and so this fabric is also assumed to have come from there.",
