    "description": "The hero Rustam was unaware that he had a son, Suhrab, by Princess Tahmina. It came to pass that the two met in battle, fighting on opposing sides. They struggled in single combat until Rustam stabbed Suhrab fatally. Rustam realized that he had slain his own son when he saw Suhrab\u2019s arm bracelet, which he himself had given to Tahmina many years before. Tahmina had given it to  Suhrab before the battle, hoping it would protect him.",
