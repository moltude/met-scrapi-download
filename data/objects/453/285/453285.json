    "description": "This illustrated folio was probably cut from its original illustrated manuscript as a line of text appears along the bottom edge of the leaf.  The image depicts a group of female attendants, musicians, and dancers surrounding a crowned central female figure who kneels on a golden throne. A crowned male figure kneels at the lower left.  One attendant on the queen's right holds a traditional axe-shaped fan, while the attendant on her left holds a fan in the shape of a sunburst, often a symbol of imperial power. All the female attendants and musicians wear a striped cap which allows us to date the painting to around 1800.  The subject matter of the painting and the manuscript from which it comes cannot be identified.",
