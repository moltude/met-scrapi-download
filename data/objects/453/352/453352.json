    "description": "This bottle was created with a number of complex glass-working techniques. The piece was made in two parts that were joined at the horizontal seam. Decoration was impressed with tongs before the pieces were joined. The blue glass thread around the rim gives a spark of color to this otherwise transparent piece. The bottle\u2019s decoration consists of repeating bulls-eyes, a pattern that was especially popular in decorating the surfaces of small bronze vessels.",
