The calligrapher Sultan  \u0312Ali Mashhadi completed the text, including both the main section and the diagonal writing, in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, but the border of this work and the three small paintings of holy men were added at a later date. The complete folio was originally owned by  \u0312Abd al-Rahim, a military commander who served under the Mughal emperors Akbar and Jahangir. When it entered the collection of Jahangir in 1624\u201325, the book was valued at 1,000 ashrafis, or 10,000 rupees, making it one of the most valuable works of the imperial library at the time.",
