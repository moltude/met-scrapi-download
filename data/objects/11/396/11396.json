    "description": "Lane returned to his native Gloucester from Boston in 1848. His works  of the 1850s and 1860s are successively purged of genre and  topographical elements, becoming increasingly spare and essential. By  1862, Lane had engineered a seamless, self-effacing style, possibly  influenced by the works of Martin Johnson Heade. Stage Fort, once the  site of military fortifications, sits on an arching land form used to  lead the viewer's eye into the glowing, lucid, and almost eerily still  distance. Despite the disjuncture between the virtually surreal,  meticulously painted foreground and the sheer plane of water near the  horizon, this work marks the transition to Lane's final, taut,  elemental style. The painting's disquieting stasis, even with its  hopeful pink and golden glow, creates a hermetic, elegiac mood found  in many of Lane's late works.",
