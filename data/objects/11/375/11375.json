    "description": "On a trip to Japan with Henry Adams in 1886, La Farge enlisted watercolor\u2014the familiar medium of the traveling artist\u2014to create studies for illustrations and to paint sheets for exhibition. He executed this bold and monumental composition after his return to New  York, using a watercolor sketch done during his travels as well as  photographs that he and Adams had taken. The Daibutsu, or Great Buddha, a fifty-foot-high bronze cast in 1252, is renowned for its colossal size, its peaceful demeanor, and its unusual site in the open  air surrounded by mountains and trees.",
