    "description": "Kensett visited Lake George in the Adirondacks on numerous occasions and made many studies of the area (see also 74.7, 74.11, 74.20). This painting is Kensett's largest and most accomplished treatment of the subject, as well as a fine example of his mature style. He has taken considerable liberties with the topography in composing the work, but certain specific sites can be identified. Kensett's vantage point was probably from Crown Island, off Bolton Landing on the west shore, looking across the lake northeast toward the Narrows. The distance has been substantially reduced in the representation, some of the islands have been omitted, and others relegated to the shore.",
