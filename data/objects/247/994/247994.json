The famous Greek sculptor Polykleitos sought rigorous, mathematically based proportions in his figures. \"Perfection comes about little by little through many numbers\" he is reported to have stated. Some idea of his attention to the smallest details can be seen in the precise design of each lock of hair on this head.",
