    "description": "Little is known about the artist Guido Heigl to whom this drawing is attributed. This is most likely largely due to his early departure at the age of 36, since his career as an artist seems to have started off quite successfully. He was awarded several prizes during his years at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna (1908 \u2013 ca. 1911/1912) and worked as a designer for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte and various other manufacturers. He is known to have made designs for textiles, silverware and the graphic arts. He is however, most often referred to as an architect, of which this design for a room with a balcony seems to be proof. Both in the drawing technique and mode of rendering, as well as in the style of the interior it reminds strongly of his professor Josef Hoffman (Austrian, Pirnitz 1870\u20131956 Vienna) and was almost certainly made while Heigl was active in the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte.",
