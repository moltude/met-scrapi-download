Beazley, the authority on Greek vase-painting, as \"brothers.\" They belonged to the same workshop, and in some cases as in this stamnos, Beazley was unable to make an attribution to one or the other. Some scholars have speculated that they were one artist.The subject matter shows two aspects of an Athenian citizen's life. The obverse, depicting a seated man with staff or scepter and phiale and a woman with an oinochoe, presents a solemn scene of offering. On the reverse are men and youths, mentors and future citizens.",
