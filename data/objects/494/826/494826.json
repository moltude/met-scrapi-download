    "description": "Head I is the earliest of Bacon\u2019s six portrait-format works included in his first exhibition at Erica Brausen\u2019s Hanover Gallery, London, in 1949.  Bacon here reduces the human form to a snarling mouth with fangs that leaves little doubt about its animal origins. The heavy impasto creates a texture that has been compared to rhinoceros skin\u2014or, as critic Robert Melville wrote at the time, the \u201ccolor of wet, black snakes lightly powdered with dust.\u201d",
