    "description": "This print is based on a small collage from 1956 that Hamilton made for \u201cThis is Tomorrow,\u201d an exhibition of the Independent Group at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. An icon of early British Pop art, the densely composed collage teems with images clipped from magazines according to the artist\u2019s prescribed inventory: Man, Woman, Humanity, History, Food, Newspapers, Cinema, TV, Telephone, Comics (picture information), Words (textual information), Tape recording (aural information), Cars, Domestic Appliances, and Space. Hamilton first reproduced and refined the collage in 1992 by scanning it into a computer. After further advances in ink-jet printing, he made this \u201cupgraded\u201d version on an Apple Macintosh in 2004.",
