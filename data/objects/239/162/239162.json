    "description": "Sporting an elaborate headdress and drapery gathered at the shoulder, the figure above the doorway is probably a heroine from the Bible or antiquity. The subject on the right (41.190.481)wears a crown of branches with grape clusters as well as pleated and knotted drapery, suggesting that he may be a figure from the classical world. Evoking ancient coins and carved gems, busts set in roundels such as this pair and its two companion pieces were typically placed on the facades of ch\u00e2teaux or above entrances and were intended to heighten their settings\u2019 classicism. The figures were often arranged as if looking at one another, maintaining a silent dialogue. The roundels are believed to have come from the ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Assier in the Lot department of France.",
