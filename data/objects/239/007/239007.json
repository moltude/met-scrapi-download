    "description": "Obverse: This is the only known medal by the celebrated Bolognese goldsmith and painter. It combines a goldsmith\u2019s precision and a learned artist\u2019s references to the coins and sculpture of classical antiquity. The medal was modeled sometime between Alidosi\u2019s appointment as Cardinal Legate in 1505, ruling Bologna on behalf of the Pope, and his murder in 1511.Reverse: The body of Jupiter, shown brandishing a thunderbolt, is based on an ancient Roman sculpture that though a fragment was already hugely famous \u2013 the Belvedere Torso, recently discovered in Rome. This reference reminds the viewer that Alidosi\u2019s power came from his position in Papal Rome \u2013 and that the medal itself revived an antique form.",
