    "description": "This pottery whistle is in the form of a bird standing on two legs and a tail.  It is a double whistle, with two internal and separate sounding chambers.  The lower chamber, located in the body of the bird, is sounded through a mouthpiece located in the tail.  This chamber has a single finger hole on the front of the bird's belly allowing for two pitches to be produced.  A second, smaller, chamber is found in the head of the bird and is activated through a mouthpiece protruding from behind the ears.",
