    "description": "In addition to the blowhole (right) and finger holes, the dizi has an extra hole between the finger holes and blowhole that is covered by a membrane or a tissue-thin piece of bamboo that produces a poignant buzzing tone. There may also be a number of vent holes at the end from which tassels are frequently hung and poems may be inscribed on the flute as an additional decoration. Dizi are usually made of bamboo, but more durable materials, such as marble or, as in this case, jade, may be used. This flute, like other dizi, could be used in solo performance or in the kungu opera, one of the styles contributing to Beijing opera.",
