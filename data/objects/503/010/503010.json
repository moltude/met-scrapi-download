    "description": "Antonio Stradivari (b. Cremona?, 1644?; d. Cremona, 1737) has long been thought to have been an apprentice of Nicol\u00f2 Amati, but census documents do not list Stradivari as a garzone (shopboy) in the Amati household.  Stradivari's early instruments do show the stylistic influence of the Amati, but as Girolamo II and Nicol\u00f2 were the principal makers in Cremona during Stradivari's formative years, it would be natural for Stradivari to have been influenced by their work.  Antonio Stradivari worked with two of his sons, Francesco (1671-1743) and Omobono (1679-1742), and today over 600 instruments survive from this prodigious workshop.  Stradivari experimented with the shape and arching of the violin.  In 1690 he devised a somewhat longer and narrower body outline that is referred to as the \"long pattern.\"  By 1700 he abandoned this pattern and reverted to the broader shape that was typical of his earlier violins.",
