    "description": "The L-shaped marble slab, which is struck at the lower end with a horn mallet, is sounded at the end of courtly ceremonial pieces. The stone's thickness determines its pitch; this one sounds approximately middle C. A larger version of the instrument, comprising sixteen tuned slabs, is called the p'yon'gyong. Both types are decorated with ducks, symbols of joy and fidelity; phoenixes (at top), symbol of peace and prosperity; and pine cones, representing good luck and longevity.",
