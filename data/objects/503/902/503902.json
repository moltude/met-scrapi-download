    "description": "Practically the smallest, simplest piano imaginable, this 54-note instrument was carried wherever its quiet music was wanted. The rectangular case and layout of the keys, strings, and soundboard derive from the clavichord.  Unlike a clavichord\u2019s fixed tangents which contact the strings while they sound, the piano's hinged hammers bounce away, letting the strings vibrate freely. The hammer's lever adds velocity to the blow, allowing a louder sound than the clavichord tangent's gentle tap.  This tiny piano lacks dampers, so every tone overlaps the next as in a harp or hammer dulcimer.  Each hammer strikes a single string. A pressure of less than 5 grams depresses the middle C key. Pianos of this shape, with strings running from side to side, are called \"squares.\"",
