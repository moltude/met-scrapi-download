    "description": "Based closely on Spanish models, this guitar replaced the Ram\u00edrez guitar (1986.353.2) as Andr\u00e9s Segovia's principal concert instrument in 1937. He used it in concerts and for recording until 1962. It is said that Hauser brought instruments to Segovia for twelve successive years but that none pleased the virtuoso until he tried this one. The two-piece back and sides are of Brazilian rosewood, the two-piece top is of spruce.",
