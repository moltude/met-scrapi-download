    "description": "The surviving fragment is the tang of an iron sword like 74.51.5670. The tang was edged with silver and revetted with ivory held in place with silvered bronze rivets. The two swords are exceptionally important because they correspond to weapons mentioned by the poet Homer. Typically Cypriot, they are best represented by a complete example found at Salamis, which may have been a center for their production.",
