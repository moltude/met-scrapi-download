    "description": "This intimate landscape, with its strong rhythmic composition,  flattened space, and tapestry-like application of paint, illustrates  the modification of Hassam's style at the turn of the century when he  absorbed Post-Impressionist developments. The painting is thought to  have been executed on the property of a friend in East Hampton who had  a beautiful lily pond surrounded by irises. Hassam was later to buy  his own home in East Hampton, where he spent long periods during the  last sixteen years of his life.",
