    "description": "In this tapestry we witness the antics of a shepherd and two shepherdesses in the fields. An older woman grabs a shepherd and he raises his hand in protest while a younger shepherdess, at the right, also raises her arm. It is not clear what is at issue here but tapestries focusing on the lives of shepherds generally have sexual overtones that would have been well understood at the time they were made. In the midst of the floral background, a bunny and a pheasant appear.",
