    "description": "Shabtis were small magical figures deposited in a tomb to answer for the deceased should he or she be called upon to do labor in the afterlife. This figure depicts Huy as he was in life: clothed in a fashionable pleated tunic and wraparound shawl and wearing an amulet associated with the goddess Hathor around his neck. His wig is of a type that seems to have been popular with both scribes and military personnel during the late 18th dynasty..",
