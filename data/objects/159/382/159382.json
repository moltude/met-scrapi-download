    "description": "Jean Dess\u00e9s originally travelled to Paris from Egypt to study law and diplomacy; however, he soon discovered that his true passion was designing.  He opened his own couture house in Paris in 1937 and became known for his characteristic twists and gathers which he magically executed on a variety of fabrics.  Considered his best work are his evening dresses of chiffon, which have the appearance of classical sculpture.  He favored ombr\u00e9 fabrics and colors other than black, such as Wedgwood blue, old rose, taupe, eggplant, green, brown, pale grays, faint pinks, and whites.  This glamorous evening gown exhibits Dess\u00e8s' draping techniques.  The use of gold Lurex is typical of the time period, for in the Fifties, it began to replace lam\u00e9.  The advantage of the new fabric being it did not tarnish.  To further enhance the elegance of this dress, the stole is trimmed in brown mink.",
