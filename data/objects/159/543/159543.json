    "description": "The Brooks Costume Company was the foremost maker of theatrical costumes in New York in the early part of the twentieth century and this ensemble is a testament to that reputation.  This is a beautifully made garment with all refined details and dressmaking techniques, including self lining, two-tone custom buttons made from the two fabrics of the dress, a cape lined with the blue satin of the shirt, and button details at the skirt.  Russian influences can be seen in the bodice of the dress with its Cossack style closure. It is also interesting to note that both the dress and the jacket look similar to the Russian-inspired dresses of Gabrielle Chanel of that same time period.",
