    "description": "Spanish-born artist and designer Mariano Fortuny was active in Italy, where he established a textile workshop and a commercial silk printing factory--a version of which still operates today. Best known for his beautiful textiles and unstructured garments, Fortuny continually referenced historical and non-Western sources, reviving and creating complex fabric treatments and dyeing techniques. The Hispano-Moresque inspired geometric interlacing of the evening jacket is adroitly executed in both gold and silver metallic stencilling. The rectangular cut and visual details typify his work: the combination of simple shapes, rich coloration and intricate patterning are quintessential Fortuny.",
