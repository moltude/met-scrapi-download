    "description": "A great attraction of Dior's feminine silhouette is the juxtaposition of proportion it creates. A full skirt balances a nipped waist or a portrait collar counteracts a fitted bodice in numerous examples of Dior's work. In this cocktail dress, the combination of proportions makes for a classic look from the designer. The dramatic wide neckline sets off an impossibly narrow elongated bodice, which widens with princess seams into a flared skirt. The simplicity of the dress makes it a showpiece for Dior's exacting design equilibrium. This garment, as well as two others (2009.300.367 and 2009.300.368a, b), were given to the Brooklyn Museum collection by one of Dior's former models.",
