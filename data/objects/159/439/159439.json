    "description": "This is a stylish fashioned garment for a child.  The coat stands out from the usual children's garment because while it has a functional wool lining, the collar and cape are lined in fragile silk.  This detail makes the piece a handsome and special object that a \"rough and tumble\" boy might wear on more special occasions.",
