    "description": "This negligee with petticoat is a good example of Belle \u00c9poque luxury dressing wear and fine American lingerie.  The visual interest is heightened by the intricate piecing of the lace and dotted swiss bands that is done in the ruffles on the bodice, sleeves and hem ruffle.  Great care has been taken in its construction, noted in the decorative seaming, which emphasizes the number of pieces of dotted swiss used to assemble the garment.  Overall, the ensemble has elegant lines that would befit a woman of high social standing.",
