    "description": "The gray flannel suit, like this one dated to 1950, became an icon of the post-World War II era focus on work and upward mobility, as men returning from war replaced their military uniforms with a corporate one. Sloan Wilson's 1955 novel, \"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,\" and the 1956 film of the same name portrayed this development as a constrictive, potentially destructive influence. The gray flannel suit became even more popular after the book's publication and publisher Simon and Schuster created life-size cardboard cutouts of the silhouetted man on the book's cover and distributed them to stores.",
