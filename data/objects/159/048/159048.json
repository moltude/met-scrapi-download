    "description": "Spanish-born artist and designer Mariano Fortuny was active in Italy, where he established a textile workshop and a commercial silk printing factory--a version of which still operates today. Best known for his beautiful textiles and unstructured garments, Fortuny continually referenced historical and non-Western sources, reviving and creating complex fabric treatments and dyeing techniques. Here, a complex, Persian-inspired pinwheel pattern is highlighted by the simple cut of the coat. The graceful shape showcases Fortuny's acute awareness of movement and light, the color changing as the wearer moves.",
