    "description": "From an early age, James Galanos knew he was destined to be a fashion designer.  Unlike his peers, he chose to build his career in Los Angeles, rather than New York's Seventh Avenue.  He is recognized for his exquisite ready-to-wear pieces that are characteristically couture, as they are as beautiful on the outside as they are on the inside.  With his extreme attention to detail and talent with luxurious fabrics, most notably silk chiffon, he created masterpieces worn by ladies of society, actresses, and former presidential lady, Nancy Reagan. The choice of fabric is undoubtedly nautical inspired, the red and white undulating stripes representing rolling waves.  Exquisitely pieced together, the stripes of the bodice are perfectly matched at the side seams.  The flowing, layered skirt adds a sense of delicacy to the dress, with a jaunty sailor-like knot at back.",
