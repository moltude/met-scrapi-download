    "description": "During the 1940s, women's suits were often fitted with shoulder pads to provide interest and excitement to clothing that was affected by war time rationing. Valentina employed that method with this suit, and also utilizes color blocking with similar shades to create an overall refined and interesting effect. The turban-like hat is another signature of the dramatic, exotic Valentina, who sometimes wore a turban herself.",
