    "description": "This dressing gown is an example of at-home-wear that became especially prevalent when it became acceptable to receive intimate guests in an informal manner.  It is made of beautiful fabric that is more distinctive than the popular paisley patterns and it has an elegant form due to its construction details.  During this time, men's smoking jackets also became popular, and this dressing gown is similar to that type of jacket or a man's banyan.",
