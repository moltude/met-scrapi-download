    "description": "This style of jacket, originally called the dress coat, was adopted in the late 18th century and was popular for every day and formal dress.   It was relegated strictly to evening wear by the middle of the century and has adapted for formal occasions since then.  This particular ensemble indicates the professional tailoring expected in the late 19th century.",
