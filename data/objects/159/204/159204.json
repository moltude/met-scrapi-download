    "description": "This dolman is made from a fine quality Indian shawl and mimics the popular bustle silhouette of the period.  The motifs are beautifully matched which indicate the skills of an expert dressmaker.  In the 1870s shawls lost popularity due to its immense size and the reducing expanse of skirts to help support them.  Although some were retained as heirlooms, others were stitched into the more wieldy shape of the mantle.",
