This notable example shows how she has adapted her swing silhouette for use with leopard skin. The dolman sleeves are an interesting touch that allows for an attractive display of this handsome fur. Designed by Trig\u00e8re, this coat, according to accession information, was made by Jerry Sorbana in 1962.",
