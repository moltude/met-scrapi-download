    "description": "The Edwardian period was an era of refinement.  Women dressed for different periods of the day, requiring a very extensive wardrobe.  From awakening in the morning until retiring in the evening, women of society dressed in only the finest.  This deshabill\u00e9 is a nice example of luxurious at-home-wear, which was traditionally a comfortable unstructured garment.  It is very likely that this garment was worn over night clothes, or before or after fully dressing.",
