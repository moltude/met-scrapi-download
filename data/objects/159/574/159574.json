    "description": "American ready-to-wear became even more abundant during the 1950s and retailers were sure to offer a variety of silhouettes to their clients.  In addition to the New Look, there was also a slim, fitted silhouette and a boxy style.  In 1957, Balenciaga introduced the sack back dress and reproductions were quickly distributed.  A fresh look, women began buying this new dress by the thousand, threatening the full-skirted silhouette.  Featured here is an example of this style in a colorful floral pattern, complete with matching pumps.",
