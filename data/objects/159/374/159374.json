    "description": "The suit featured here maintains the same form and construction of boy's suits from the nineteenth century, which includes interior buttons to attach the shirt to the short pants. At this time, there was no longer the graduation from short pants to long pants as a coming of age, which was common practice in the Victorian era and early twentieth century.  During the mid-twentieth century shorts were still an option for young boys to wear, although it was probably less common for a boy of this age.  This suit was possibly manufactured by Saks Fifth Avenue, a high end retailer selling the highest quality children's clothing available.",
