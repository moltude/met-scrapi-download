    "description": "The Hungarian sz\u00fcr is derived from mantles over 2500 years old, and continued to be worn into the early 20th century. The garment was worn by shepherds mostly, providing protection from the harsh elements. Their thick wool felt was protective against cold and wet, and the long collars were adorned with roundels at the lower corners that could be connected to form a hood. Generally knee to mid-calf length, they were heavily adorned with embroidery and appliqu\u00e9s specific to their locality. The sz\u00fcr was usually worn draped over the shoulders, with the sleeves hanging loose. It was a much-coveted object, and so costly that many men resorted to thievery to afford one. This particular sz\u00fcr's embroidery is of the K\u00fans\u00e1g-type, created in Szentistv\u00e1n, Borsad County in Upper Hungary.Stewart Culin (1858-1929) was the Brooklyn Museum's first Curator of Ethnology from 1903 to 1929. Culin conducted collecting expeditions, traveling throughout the United States and the world. His goals for these trips were not just to expand the Museum's holdings, but to also provide context for these objects within their cultures. In addition to choosing rare and high-quality pieces, Culin sought artifacts with interesting provenance as well.",
