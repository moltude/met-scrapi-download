    "description": "The American artist Stuart Davis (1894-1964) was best known for pioneering a distinctly American form of Cubism.  His work featured flat, abstracted forms, with hard edges defined by strongly contrasting colors.  Davis also designed textiles in which he employed similar designs.  The textile of this dress, designed and made by his wife, Roselle, in 1938,  illustrates how he translated  the forms he used in his paintings to a design appropriate for constructing into a garment. While this dress was made by Mrs. Davis, the department store Franklin Simon advertised dresses made in this fabric in the spring of 1938.",
