    "description": "On view Rotation 1, August 17 to November 3, 2013A mandarin orange tree (tachibana) bearing fruit and flowers rises from the center back hem of this narrow-sleeved robe (kosode) in a design scheme typical of the second half of the eighteenth century. At the top, the sleeves and upper body of the robe are embellished with auspicious characters richly embroidered in green or purple silk or in gold thread. The three characters read (left to right): Manzai- raku \u842c\u6b73\u697d, which literally means, \u201cEnjoying comfort for ten thousand years.\u201d Manzai-raku is also the name of a type of ancient court music and dance (bugaku) that was performed to celebrate the New Year\u2019s season. The phrase calls to mind a song from the auspicious Noh play Takasago, which proclaims that performing Manzai-raku brings long life.",
