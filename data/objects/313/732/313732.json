    "description": "In addition to creating larger works of sacred sculpture, the peoples of the Sepik region in northeast New Guinea have highly developed traditions of decorative arts. As elsewhere in New Guinea, much of Sepik decorative art is devoted to the adornment of the human body. Sepik artists create diverse forms of jewelry, headdresses, and other personal ornaments. Personal possessions such as weapons, charms, and a variety of paraphernalia associated with the use of betel nut (the fruit of the areca palm, which is chewed as a mild stimulant) are often superbly crafted and adorned. As in larger works, the human and animal images that appear on these smaller objects typically portray ancestors, spirits, and other supernatural beings as well as totemic species associated with the owner's clan.",
