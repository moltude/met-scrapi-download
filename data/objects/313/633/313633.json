    "description": "In the past, the grandest structures in most villages of the Sentani people of Lake Sentani in northwest New Guinea were the houses of hereditary chiefs. Like all Sentani dwellings, they were built over the water and were supported by wood pilings. Chiefs' houses were lavishly decorated with architectural carvings of twobasic types: house post figures, such as the present work, which adorned the tops of the pilings that supported the floor, and tall Y-shaped posts, which supported the central roof beam.       Likely depicting an important clan ancestor, this image once adorned the top of a Sentani house post.  When in use, the lower portion of the post was embedded inthe lake-bed and the carved image protruded through the floor of the house. In Sentani oral tradition, the first ancestors lived underground and emerged to populate the earth. The placement and imagery of the posts, whose ancestral figures rose from the earth to emerge through the floor of the dwelling, may have been a symbolic reference to that story.Left:House Post FigureSentani people, probably Kabiterau village,Lake Sentani, New Guinea, Papua (Irian Jaya)Province, Indonesia, 19th centuryWoodThe Michael C.

Constructed onwood pilings, houses and other structures in Sentani villagesare linked together by boardwalks, allowing the residents toreach any part of the village without the use of canoes.Until the early 1920s, the most imposing structures inSentani villages were the houses of the ondoforo, hereditarychiefs who were both the political and religious leaders ofsociety. Although ordinary dwellings were unadorned, thehouses of the ondoforo often were lavishly decorated witharchitectural sculpture. The Sentani also had a rich traditionof decorative art, creating beautifully decorated bowls,canoes, paddles, bark cloth, and personal accessories, whichoften were decorated with distinctive S-shaped spirals. Theimagery of Sentani art often shows close stylistic affinitieswith that of the peoples of Humboldt Bay, with whom theyregularly interacted.",
