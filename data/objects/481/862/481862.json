    "description": "Johns rarely makes studies for paintings, rendering this large sketch something of an exception. The resulting painting follows its specifications closely: a ruler, attached to the stretcher bar by a wing nut, scrapes an arc of wax-based encaustic paint before being halted by a small metal cup. The thick blotting paper used for this study allowed Johns to abrade the surface without rupturing it, in order to approximate the ruler\u2019s future movement across the painting\u2019s surface. Partaking of Johns\u2019s extensive interest in impressions, traces and imprints, this disruption of the paper\u2019s surface amounts to a subtle lateral tear, like rubbing away a layer of skin.",
