    "description": "In 1962 Harvey Littleton held a series of informal workshops exploring the art of hot glassmaking in a studio. Until then, most glass objects had been blown or molded in an industrial setting-the only place artists could find the facilities to produce their work. With Littleton's determination and the involvement of other artists, the studio-glass movement was born. For Amber Crested Form, Littleton massed a dolphin-shaped appendage onto an assemblage that includes a hollow tube. He then allowed the weight and tension of the cooling glass to manipulate the outcome.",
