    "description": "Although most Art Deco patrons were French, one of the era\u2019s most complete, important residential design projects was realized in America: a penthouse apartment in San Francisco designed for Templeton Crocker (1884\u20131948), the millionaire grandson of the founder of the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Completed in 1928, the apartment contained a master bedroom, dining room,and breakfast room by Dunand; the noted French designers Jean-Michel Frank, Pierre Legrain, and Madame Lipska created the other rooms. The apartment was dismantled and sold in 1959.The \u201csponged\u201d surface of Dunand\u2019s master-bedroom furniture is characteristic of lacque arrach\u00e9, a technique in which a final coat of lacquer (here, metallic gray) is applied over a roughened layer (black). By polishing the entire surface, the raised peaks of the black lacquer were revealed, creating a mottled yet smooth effect. This unusual table from the bedroom suite illustrates a rare instance in which the vocabulary of Cubism is able to transform a utilitarian piece of furniture into a piece of abstract sculpture.",
