    "description": "This bronze ewer has an undecorated globular body and a long cylindrical neck. Bands of scrolling vines bearing trefoils and spade-shaped leaves are engraved at the bottom and top of the neck. A thumb rest in the form of a pomegranate is placed at the top of a beaded handle. Although perhaps not as ornate as similarly shaped silver vessels examples like this bronze ewer relate to, such pieces had significant material value in their own right as hefty pieces of worked metal.",
