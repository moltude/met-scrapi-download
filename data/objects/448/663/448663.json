    "description": "This earthenware bowl, with its running, three-clawed dragon, was clearly based on a Chinese prototype available either through drawings or actual ceramic examples of the early fifteenth century. Wares of this type have been excavated in various sites in Iran and Central Asia, but their relatively inferior quality suggests that true Chinese blue-and-white porcelain was preferred at Timurid courts.",
