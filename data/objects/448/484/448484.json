    "description": "Mughal paintings from the seventeenth century sometimes depict the private life of the court, illustrating the quiet moments of emperors, queens, princes, and princesses in a manner very different from formal portraits. Here, women reclining on carpets and cushions surround themselves with food, drink, and exquisite objects that provide detailed records of courtly life. Theodore M. Davis, an American Egyptologist and lawyer, bound this painting into an album with other works from seventeenth and eighteenth century India and Iran, and thus the name \"The Davis Album\".",
