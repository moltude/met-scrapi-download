    "description": "During the seventeenth century, rows of flowering plants became fashionable designs for textiles in Iran, India, and Turkey. In this early example, a design of undulating white stems (originally silver) and branches of roses, irises, and other flowers are set against a background of gold. Safavid weavers of this period were particularly adept at creating the sense of a continuous composition out of repeating design units and Safavid textiles were among the finest and most popular fabrics sold locally and on the international market.",
