    "description": "This textile fragment of uneven shape is decorated with tapestry-woven inscriptions and floral patterns on an undyed linen ground. An Arabic inscription in kufic script that includes the name of the caliph, Al-Radi (r. 934\u201340), runs across the piece at the center with a mirror image of the same inscription directly below it. This fragment is likely from the same textile as fragment 29.179.5b. They were either produced in private workshops or in workshops belonging to the caliph where fabrics were woven exclusively as gifts or for the royal household and members of the court.",
