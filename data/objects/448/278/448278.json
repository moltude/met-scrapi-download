    "description": "This work, drawn shortly before the high point of Mughal portraiture, shows an aged emperor Akbar holding a rosary during prayer. It was commissioned soon before or after his death in 1605 and is paired with a similar portrait of his son and successor Jahangir. Although neutral tones dominate, the sash around his waist is accented in red and blue. The underdrawing, especially visible at Akbar\u2019s feet and legs, indicates that the artist departed from his original plan in the process of executing this portrait.",
