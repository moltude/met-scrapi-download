    "description": "One of the ukiyo-e artists' favorite scenes in the Tale of Genji was an episode from Chapter 34, or New Herbs I. The youth Kashiwagi happens to notice a kitten running out from under a bamboo blind, behind which he glimpses the elegant figure of the Third Princess, one of Genji's wives. Kashiwagi falls in love with her, to disastrous effect. In this diptych, the Third Princess is visually tied to Kashiwagi by the leash of the cat he is holding.",
