    "description": "The source of red for beni-e coloring, as shown here, was safflower (benibana). Beautifully hand-colored prints like this one clearly foretell the technique of multicolored brocade prints invented by Suzuki Harunobu in 1765. Broad ink lines have receded into thin regular outlines to better integrate with colored patterns, while the landscape on a sliding panel shows an ink monochrome painting inspired by the Kano school.A pipe-smoking patron in the pleasure quarters has engaged the services of both a young woman and a young man. The poem at the far left includes phrases that can be translated as \"fragrant plum trees\" and \"two guardian kings,\" witty references to the young man and woman.",
