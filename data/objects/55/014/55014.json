His coquette is a far cry from the lovely aristocratic beauty portrayed some three decades earlier by Utamaro.  Her angular features, long slanting eyes, half-open pouting lips with a touch of iridescent green, little red ribbon and suggestive crook of a finger betrays her coy and slightly wanton nature.",
