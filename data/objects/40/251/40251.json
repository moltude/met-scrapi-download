    "description": "Several complicated techniques were used to create the lively design of a dragon flying above a rock and waves. The dragon was first carved into the surface and then filled with gold and colored lacquers. In some cases, several layers of lacquer were added to the incised outlines, and the resulting decoration, which extended above the surface of the dish, was then polished down to make the surface even.",
