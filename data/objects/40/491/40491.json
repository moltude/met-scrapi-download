    "description": "In the nineteenth century Shibata Zeshin, who exhibited at several world's fairs, was one of the few Japanese artists known in the West. He is noted both for his use of lacquer as a painting medium and for his innovative melding of techniques and unusual materials in lacquers. The boats here are made of pewter that was roughly finished with lacquer, while the traditional \"sprinkled gold\" (maki-e) technique defines the sheaves of rice. The combed pattern on the waves illustrates Zeshin's revival of the \"blue wave\" (seigaiha-nuri) technique, in which lacquer thickened with egg white or clay is placed on a surface and then combed into a pattern with a bamboo brush. Small pieces of pearl shell form the plovers flying over the scene, which has autumnal overtones.",
