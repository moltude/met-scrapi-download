    "description": "Watery ink and small gold flecks sprinkled among valleys and mist create a luminous night scene under a hazy moon. The gentleman riding in the boat on the right screen is the famous Tang Chinese poet Li Bo (701\u2013762), who was inspired by moonlit Mount Emei in Sichuan to compose a poem:The autumn moon is half round above theEmei Mountain;Its pale light falls in and flows with the water ofthe Pingqiang River.Tonight I leave Qingxi of the limpid stream forthe Three Gorges,And glide down past Yuzhou, thinking of youwhom I cannot see.Four years later, Li Bo returned to the area and composed a longer poem. In Japan, the two poems became particularly famous. Shiokawa Bunrin's training was in the realist school of Shij\u014d , but he was also familiar with the aesthetics of the nanga, or bunjinga, literati school. These screens exhibit Bunrin's knowledge of Western perspective, especially inthe treatment of the valley stream.  A document accompanying the screens, written by Bunrin himself and dated to 1875, suggests that the pair was painted shortly before",
