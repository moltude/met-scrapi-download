    "description": "This spare, enigmatic scene represents a revolutionary redirection in Chinese painting. Zhao Mengfu reduces his \"painted\" landscape to a set of calligraphic brush conventions, with the rocks executed in \"flying-white\" cursive and the pines outlined in unmodulated seal script. He thus rejects illusionistic representation and relies instead on expressive brush lines to imbue his imagery with personal meaning. Zhao underscores his commitment to this new approach by adding a title to the right of his pines and writing a long inscription on top of the distant mountains at the left side of the composition, making it clear that his painting is not merely about landscape scenery.Despite his adherence to this new style, Zhao chooses a traditionally significant subject. In Chinese art, pine trees have long been emblems of survival. By representing them here, Zhao may be referring to his own political survival under the Mongol occupation, as well as to the endurance of Chinese culture under foreign rule.DOCUMENTATIONArtist\u2019s inscriptions and signature2 columns in semi-cursive script (undated):Zi\u2019ang [Zhao Mengfu] playfully painted this Twin Pines, Level Distance.\u5b50\u6602\u6232\u4f5c\u96d9\u677e\u5e73\u9060\u30026 columns in semi-cursive script (undated):Ever since my youth, after practicing calligraphy, I have toyed with some small paintings, but landscape is one subject that I have not been able to master.  This is because I have not managed to see even one or two masterpieces by Wang Wei (701\u2013761), the senior and junior general Li [i.e. Li Sixun (active 705\u2013720) and Li Zhaodao (active mid-8th c.)], and Zheng Qian (active mid-8th c.) of the Tang period.  As for works of the Five Dynasties masters, such as Jing Hao (active ca. 870\u2013930), Guan Tong (active ca. 907\u201323), Dong Yuan (active 930s-60s), and Fan Kuan (ca. 960\u2013ca. 1030), who succeeded one another [as leading masters], the \u201cbrush idea\u201d [biyi] of all of them is absolutely different from the style of recent paintings.  As for my own work, I dare not compare it with those of the ancient masters, but when I look at what recent painters have done, I daresay mine is a bit different.

Suxuan\u2019s character and family background compare closely with Wenmin\u2019s, so, respecting the man, he loves his painting.  In the precious Yuan dynasty, Wenmin attained the position of Recipient of Edicts in the Hanlin Academy through his literary accomplishment.  At the time, scholars and officials admired his superiority in a dozen things; his talents were certainly not limited to painting and calligraphy.  However, as a descendant of the imperial family of the past Song dynasty, he served the Yuan ruler.  I suspect that his fellow scholar-officials\u2019 opinions of him resonated with the message of the poem \u201cReaching Old Age with the Husband\u201d in the Odes of Yong.[4] I wonder how Ban Gu (32\u201392) and Sima Qian (ca. 145\u2013ca. 86 B.C.) would think of him.[5] Inscribed by Tong Xuan of Poyang [in Jiangxi], Assistant Surveillance Commissioner of Yunnan.
