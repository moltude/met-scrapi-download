    "description": "In an inventive combination of informality and grand effect, Kamali exploits the silver and dove silk of parachute cloth for evening wear.  She creates an inflated silhouette akin to eighteenth-century fashioning in the fullness and curtainlike drape of the abundant fabric.  Kamali contrasts the utilitarian material with the lavishness of a profligate billowing skirt. Jumpsuit (1978.163.1a-d) in background of same materials also by Kamali, created especially for Diana Vreeland to be displayed in the exhibition \"Vanity Fair.\"",
