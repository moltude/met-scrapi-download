    "description": "The 1830s silhouette was created by a corseted, raised waistline; here a bell-shaped skirt reveals the lower ankle.  By the late 1830s, the gigot sleeve was collapsing at the sleeve cap, but in this case, its detachable pelerine, or capelet, sustained the broad triangulated shoulder line of the period. The similarities between men's and women's fashion extended to footwear: women could wear flat slippers or tiny booties not so different from the boots and walking shoes of men.",
