    "description": "In a reference to Persia, Callot Soeurs created a kind of artistic dress of the 1920s, stark in its tubular silhouette but ornamented on the surface.  Despite the presence of decoration, for which they were perhaps best known at the time, Callot Soeurs practiced a disciplined modernism.  This day dress with collarless tunic employs a vestigially Ottoman angled sleeve with narrow cuffs.",
