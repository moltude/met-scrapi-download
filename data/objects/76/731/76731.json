    "description": "On display Rotation 2, November 9, 2013\u2013January 12, 2014An asymmetrical pattern of drying fishing nets and a repeating Japanese character for \u201cwarbler\u201d (uguisu \u9daf) in highly cursive script adorns the back of this narrow-sleeved robe (kosode). Such asymmetrical designs became fashionable during the Kanbun period (1661\u201373), when the back of the kosode was the focal point of the composition. Japanese illustrated pattern books of the period show many similar designs, sweeping in a dramatic curve from the lower right hem to the upper left shoulder. In this example, looming fishing nets playfully echo that curve, almost like giant waves.The pattern is executed in three colors\u2014blue, light red-orange, and purple\u2014each in a different type of stitched or tied resist dyeing (shibori) with details in embroidery of silk and gold metallic thread. The foundation is an off-white silk damask weave with a repeating pattern of paulownia flowers on a geometric background of diagonal rectangles.",
