    "description": "Individual branches and pine needles have been conflated into pale green and orange forms floating above spindly trunks, evoking Rinpa-style pine trees executed using the mottled ink technique known as tarashikomi. Whereas the painter must manipulate layers of pigment applied to moist surfaces to achieve the variegated tones that are a hallmark of tarashikomi, the maker of this kimono applied colorants by hand in subtle gradations on a paste-resist dyed surface to achieve a similar appearance. The truncated pine trees, outlined with gold-painted accents, are lightly veiled in a barely discernible haze of gold highlights.",
