    "description": "This pair of armchairs belong to Shao\u2019s Chair series in which historic Ming-style forms are transformed into sleek, sometimes surreal, modern hybrids using contemporary forms, techniques, and materials. These works not only illuminate aesthetic connections across time and culture, but also demonstrate how China\u2019s past can both adapt to and coexist with its rapidly changing and increasingly globalized present.",
