    "description": "The dragon is a fantastic animal that originated in China and spread throughout Asia. The dragon on this jacket is seen among clouds and bolts of lightning in a setting rendered specifically and unmistakably Japanese by the presence of Mount Fuji. The jacket may have belonged to a firefighter in the city of Edo (present-day Tokyo), which, owing to climactic conditions and combustible building materials, was especially susceptible to destructive blazes. Some scholars suggest that the patterns on firemen's jackets were selected to provide protection to the firefighter. In the case of this jacket, East Asian tradition associates the dragon with water, and the majestic Mount Fuji has long inspired awe.",
