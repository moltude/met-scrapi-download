    "description": "Less formal than a dragon robe, the ceremonial robe was worn by women for celebratory occasions, such as birthdays and anniversaries. This robe, similar to examples from the tomb of the Qing-dynasty prince Guo (d. 1738) and his household, is decorated primarily with bats. They wheel and glide in the background, appear with interlocking wings to form medallions, and recur in the neckbands, sleevebands, and cuffs. The bat in general stands for \"good fortune\" (fu), as the two words are homophones.",
