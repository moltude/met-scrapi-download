    "description": "These miniature rock-crystal reliquaries were turned on a lathe. Rock crystal was revered in the early Buddhist world for its purity and ability to transmit light. Each hemisphere has a receptacle to accommodate relics of the Buddha\u2014ash, gold, charred bone, and pearls\u2014and a stopper in the form of a square terraced capital (harmika) surmounted by umbrellas. According to early Buddhist Vinaya texts prescribing monastic conduct, the corporeal relics of the Buddha were to be deposited in a reliquary and housed in a sarira stupa. Multiple relic containers were to be provided, with a gold or rock-crystal reliquary at the heart of the assemblage containing the actual relic. Similar rock-crystal reliquaries have been excavated from monumental stupas in central and western Sri Lanka, such as those at Anuradhapura and Dalivada, datable to the early centuries A.D",
