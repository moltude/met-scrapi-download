    "description": "The theme of Zhong Kui quelling demons was first recorded by Shen Gua (1031\u20131091), who relates that the Tang-dynasty emperor Minghuang (r. 712\u201356) was purportedly cured of an illness after dreaming about a large ghost\u2014 Zhong Kui\u2014eating demons. In the dream, Zhong Kui told the emperor that he wanted to serve him by eliminating demons. Ever since, he has been venerated as a protector against evil. In this complicated group of figures, which is carefully fitted into the natural shape of the bamboo, he is shown seated on the back of a recumbent demon, while another offers him a cup of wine.",
