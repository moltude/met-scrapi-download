    "description": "This striking abstract design closely resembles that found on Kraak ware, Chinese blue-and-white porcelain exported to Europe in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The style is unusual in Korean porcelain. Also exceptional is the inscription in Korean characters (Hangeul) drilled into the glaze just above the foot. A number of porcelains with Hangeul inscriptions were produced from about the 1830s through the end of the nineteenth century. Many were used for celebratory events at the royal palace.",
