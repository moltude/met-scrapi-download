    "description": "The contemporary Korean potter Lee In-chin (b. 1957) created these two exquisite ceramic vessels (2009.296 and 2009.297) in July 2008, during a monthlong stay at Alfred University, New York, which is renowned for its ceramics school. Using local clay, glaze, and a wood-burning kiln, the artist created thoroughly modern interpretations of a traditional Korean art form: long-necked celadon bottles from the Goryeo period (918\u20131392). In the process, Lee, who was previously best known for his works inspired by Japanese Bizen ware, has come to exemplify a phenomenon both utterly contemporary and as old as time\u2014the border-crossing hybrid.",
