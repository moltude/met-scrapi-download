    "description": "This superb example of Pala decorative art supported an icon (now missing), probably of a seated Buddhist deity in an articulated lotusbud mandala. The finely modeled openwork design is enhanced with independently cast and gilded ornaments, two of which survive: a flame motif and a conch shell. Few such lotus pedestals from the Pala period have survived, though the form is often depicted in contemporary Tibetan tankas. The Burmese provenance is a reminder of the close connections that existed between eastern India and the Burmese kingdom of Pagan in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.",
