    "description": "An adherent of the Pure Land School of Buddhism compiled the content of these albums\u2014slips of paper brushed with the name of the Buddha Amida (Sanskrit: Amit\u0101bha)\u2014on temple visits. The signed and sealed slips indicate that most of the calligraphers were abbots of Pure Land temples in the greater Edo (Tokyo) area. The albums also have paintings of Amida, as well as Shandao, an influential Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) monk; H\u014dnen, the founder of the Pure Land School in Japan; and a youthful Shinran, the founder of the True Pure Land School. A portrait of the monk Y\u016bten Kenyo (1637\u20131718), who served as the thirty-sixth abbot of the Edo temple Z\u014dj\u014dji, appears on the right-hand side of a page of one album. Y\u016bten was born in the south of what is now Fukushima Prefecture, and entered Z\u014dj\u014dji as a novice at the age of twelve. He struggled in the academic environment there and left, but later, a dream encounter with the deity Fud\u014d My\u014do (Sanskrit: Achala Vidy\u0101r\u0101ja) is said to have led to a personal transformation, following which he became famous for his ability to ensure birth in the Pure Land for those afflicted by tormented human spirits (onry\u014d). One from a set (94.18.2\u2013.5)",
