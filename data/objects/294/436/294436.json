    "description": "In 2006 the Metropolitan Museum was approached by a British arts organization who had commissioned the artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, who work independently but also make films collaboratively, to make a new short feature under their auspices. They had an unusual request: they wanted to make a film in the Metropolitan but in the middle of the night. Under the cover of darkness and armed with a flash strobe, a 16mm film camera, and some track on which to move it, the artists glided through the museum, flashing their source of illumination at discreet intervals on freestanding objects and those in cases. As a result, the way in which the works of art are usually presented falls away, and the objects\u2014often ritual or devotional in their original function\u2014become eerily enlivened and animated, almost like characters in a new ritual of unknown intent.",
