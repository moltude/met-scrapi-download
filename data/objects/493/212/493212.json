    "description": "Olga de Amaral's \"woven walls\" are suffused with the essence of Colombia, her native country. The landscape and the architecture of old houses with adobe walls and tile roofs are incorporated in a nonfigurative way into her tapestries. Color and structure are de Amaral's most important formal concerns. In Umbra 30 the intricately woven and richly embellished ultramarine and silver strips recall Columbia's rivers and waterfalls.",
