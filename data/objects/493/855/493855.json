    "description": "Lalique began designing glass at the turn of the twentieth century, at firstincorporating small amounts of it in his jewelry and later creating ornamentaland utilitarian objects entirely out of the material. His vases and stemwarebecame immensely popular, and before long his glass could be purchased allover the world. The majority of his works were machine-made from reusablemetal molds. Although his \u201cTourbillons\u201d vase was produced in quantity, theboldness of its concept and the complexity of its finish suggest that it was madeby hand. Lalique sold \u201cTourbillons\u201d vases in a variety of hues, but by far hismost effective scheme was a body of clear, colorless glass with the outer edgesof the deep walls highlighted in black enamel. The strong patterning of swirlinglines gives it a dynamism that stands alone in his oeuvre.",
