    "description": "From the mid-1930s to mid-1940s, before he turned to abstraction, Lewis made paintings and prints that illustrated the hardships of urban life in the North for African-Americans.  These works followed the imagery and ideology of the Social Realists, a group of American artists who saw art as a means for social change.  Notably, however, Lewis viewed the economic and political issues that confronted all Americans in terms of their particular impact on the black community.  Adopting the narrative, representational style of Social Realism, he produced such poignant pictures as The Soup Kitchen, which draws attention to the hopelessness felt by the legions of unemployed.  Anonymous and defeated, these men line up at one of the WPA-sponsored kitchens for a free bowl of soup.",
