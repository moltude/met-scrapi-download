    "description": "In this optically complex self-portrait, Hamilton re-creates the illusion of touching the surface of a mirror, which results in the simultaneous views of the back of his extended hand and arm and the front of his face and body. Palindrome\u2014derived from the Greek words for \u201cfast\u201d (palin) and \u201creturn\u201d or \u201crebound\u201d (dromos)\u2014applies to words, numbers, or phrases that read the same backward or forward (for example, \u201ceye\u201d) and to photons bouncing off a reflective surface. Created especially for the group portfolio Mirrors of the Mind, published by Marian Goodman andMultiples Inc., New York, Palindrome gave the artist the impetus to try a new technology\u2014lenticular, laminated, three-dimensional printing.",
