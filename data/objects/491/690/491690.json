    "description": "While working with the printer Aldo Crommelynck in Paris on an illustration for James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses (1922), Hamilton found a small cracked mirror inthe studio and made this self-portrait as part of an exploration of soft-ground etching. Peering above his reading glasses at his long, bearded face, herecorded the fractured image with an etching needle directly onto a metal plate covered with soft wax. The delicacy of the line and the presence of the artist\u2019s fingerprints in the lower section indicate the receptiveness of the wax.",
