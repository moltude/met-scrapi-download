    "description": "In recent years, Tillmans has applied his undisputed technical skills and mastery of color toward a new interest in abstraction; the same loose, improvisational mode that characterized his magazine work, now harnessed to a larger ambition, has also resulted in a deeper emotional impact that suffuses all of his efforts.Starstruck #3 is an abstract photograph composed of thin, jittery black lines across a pink color field. Much of Tillmans' work aspires to the visceral appeal of music, and this affecting image evokes the \"visual\" scores of John Cage, who combined aspects of drawing and musical notation in his compositions.",
