    "description": "\"On January 14 I was asked to do a piece on a local television station by Phyllis Lutjeans.  After several proposals were censored by the station or by Phyllis, I agreed to an interview situation.  I arrived at the station with my own video crew so that I could have my own tape.  While the taping was in progress, I requested that the show be transmitted live.  Since the station was not broadcasting [anything else] at the time, they complied.  In the course of the interview, Phyllis asked me to talk about some of the pieces I had thought of doing.  I demonstrated a TV hijack.  Holding a knife at her throat, I threatened her life if the station stopped live transmission.  I told her that I planned to make her perform obscene acts.  At the end of the recording, I asked for the tape of the show.  I unwound the reel and destroyed the show by dousing the tape with acetone.  The station manager was irate, and I offered him my tape which included the show and its destruction, but he refused.\"",
