    "description": "The source images in Ruff\u2019s \u201cnudes\u201d series were culled from the sea of pornography that floods the Internet. The artist, who often works with appropriated imagery, downloaded the pictures and manipulated them on his computer, intensifying colors, blurring outlines, and greatly enlarging the scale. At once visually ravishing and provocatively blunt, the photographs address the collapse between public and private in contemporary culture as well as the tradition of voyeuristic delectation inspired by the many pictures of female flesh hanging in this or any other art museum.",
