    "description": "Among the first to photograph Mexico's Mayan ruins, the French archaeologist-adventurer D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay gained considerable fame with the publication of his photographs and an account of his travels entitled Cit\u00e9s et ruines am\u00e9ricaines: Mitla, Palenqu\u00e9, Izamal, Chichen-Itza, Uxmal (1862-63). In this plate from the album, Charnay photographed a corner of the \"Priest's House\" at Mitla (a.d. 800-1200) as the strong sunlight of the Yucatan sliced across the courtyard-an outsized version of the building's later sundial, marking the daily passage of time in the sun's movement across centuries old walls.",
