    "description": "This detailed wall design by the artist \u00c9tienne de Lavall\u00e9e-Poussin is a very beautiful example of how elements from Classical Antiquity were adapted to fit a modern-day 18th-century interior. The overall scheme of his design \u2013 a fireplace in the center, combined with painted wall panels and the torch\u00e8res - goes back to 17th-century French examples, but the individual parts are all attuned to the latest taste for neoclassical design. He combines stern architectural elements with a light sculptural relief and playful decorations to form a very original scheme. Several mythological themes are introduced in the d\u00e9cor. The wall panels portray the Venus and Adonis (left) and Diana, goddess of the hunt (right), while in the sculptural details we find Leda and the Swan and Venus and Cupid. The partially applied washes indicate that many elements were to be gilded. The artist also added an alternate view for the fireplace with the hearth opened up, a detail which has unfortunately been lost, but can be deduced from the abraded strip on the bottom of the sheet where the addition was originally attached.",
