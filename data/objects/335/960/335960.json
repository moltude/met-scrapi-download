    "description": "Gilles-Marie Oppenord was the son of the cabinet maker Jean-Alexandre Oppenord who, during the latter part of his career, worked at the Louvre in the service of the French king as \u2018\u00c9beniste du Roi\u2019. After his first training, Gilles-Marie spent seven years in Italy where he studied the Baroque monuments built by his contemporaries and the great masters of previous generations. Collecting thoughts and inspiration on paper would prove to be a life-long exercise for him. Although not many of his executed buildings and interiors survive today, many drawings can be attributed to his hand. On this sheet he seems to have specifically collected architectural elements with a supporting function. Although the arrangement of the motifs on the sheet seems somewhat chaotic, the drawing has a very strong overall appeal. The publisher Gabriel Huquier (French, Orl\u00e9ans 1695\u20131772 Paris) must have recognized this appeal since he adopted the lay-out of this sheet (or left it unaltered) in several print series in the published \u2018Oeuvre\u2019 containing Oppenord\u2019s designs for ornament and the interior.",
