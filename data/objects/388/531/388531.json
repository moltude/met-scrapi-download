    "description": "View of the Piazzo Navona during the Jubilee celebration of 1650 held by the Spanish. The print shows the square from the south end. Ephemeral architecture has been erected around and on the square and fireworks are lit on two obelisks placed on either side of Bernini's Four River Fountain. There are many people on the square and a parade seems to circle around the full lenght of the Piazza. Numbers and letters are added to the view, respectively elucidating the buildings and ephemeral structures in the margin below the image.",
