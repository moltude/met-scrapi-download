In imitation of imported Chinese porcelain that was much admired in the Netherlands, these vases and beakers are painted in blue against a white ground. The scattered clusters of spring flowers, however, are European in nature. This set was created at the Metaale Pot (metal pot) one of the leading pottery factories in Delft which produced its most brilliant work between 1691 and 1724 under the ownership of Lambertus van Eenhoorn (1651-1721) and later his widow, Margaretha Teckmann.",
