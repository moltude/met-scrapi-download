    "description": "Pope Saint Gregory VII excommunicated Emperor Henry IV for his interference in the appointment of clergy. In winter 1077 Henry followed the pope to Canossa and waited barefoot in the snow outside the casle for three days until he received a pardon. The scene, rarely shown in the eighteenth century, perhaps found special resonance in Bologna, the leading city of the Papal States. Gandolfi, a painter who was also an expressive sculptor, conceived an original and picturesque solution, giving the emperor shelter in a blasted tree trunk, his crown at his feet.",
